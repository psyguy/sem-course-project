  abstract = {Recent experimental studies and theoretical models have begun to address the challenge of establishing a causal link between subjective conscious experience and measurable neuronal activity. The present review focuses on the well-delimited issue of how an external or internal piece of information goes beyond nonconscious processing and gains access to conscious processing, a transition characterized by the existence of a reportable subjective experience. Converging neuroimaging and neurophysiological data, acquired during minimal experimental contrasts between conscious and nonconscious processing, point to objective neural measures of conscious access: late amplification of relevant sensory activity, long-distance cortico-cortical synchronization at beta and gamma frequencies, and ``ignition'' of a large-scale prefronto-parietal network. We compare these findings to current theoretical models of conscious processing, including the Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW) model according to which conscious access occurs when incoming information is made globally available to multiple brain systems through a network of neurons with long-range axons densely distributed in prefrontal, parieto-temporal, and cingulate cortices. The clinical implications of these results for general anesthesia, coma, vegetative state, and schizophrenia are discussed.},

  abstract = {We compare the way two models of consciousness treat subjective timing. According to the standard ``Cartesian Theater'' model, there is a place in the brain where ``it all comes together,'' and the discriminations in all modalities are somehow put into registration and ``presented'' for subjective judgment. The timing of the events in this theater determines subjective order. According to the alternative ``Multiple Drafts'' model, discriminations are distributed in both space and time in the brain. These events do have temporal properties, but those properties do not determine subjective order because there is no single, definitive ``stream of consciousness,'' only a parallel stream of conflicting and continuously revised contents. Four puzzling phenomena that resist explanation by the Cartesian model are analyzed: (1) a gradual apparent motion phenomenon involving abrupt color change (Kolers \& von Gr{\"u}nau 1976), (2) an illusion of an evenly spaced series of ``hops'' produced by two or more widely spaced series of taps delivered to the skin (Geldard \& Sherrick's ``cutaneous rabbit'' [1972]), (3) backwards referral in time, and (4) subjective delay of consciousness of intention (both reported in this journal by LIbet 1985a; 1987; 1989a). The unexamined assumptions that have always made the Cartesian Theater so attractive are exposed and dismantled. The Multiple Drafts model provides a better account of the puzzling phenomena, avoiding the scientific and metaphysical extravagances of the Cartesian Theater: The temporal order of subjective events is a product of the brain's interpretational processes, not a direct reflection of events making up those processes.},

  abstract = {A set of hypotheses is formulated for a connectionist approach to cognitive modeling. These hypotheses are shown to be incompatible with the hypotheses underlying traditional cognitive models. The connectionist models considered are massively parallel numerical computational systems that are a kind of continuous dynamical system. The numerical variables in the system correspond semantically to fine-grained features below the level of the concepts consciously used to describe the task domain. The level of analysis is intermediate between those of symbolic cognitive models and neural models. The explanations of behavior provided are like those traditional in the physical sciences, unlike the explanations provided by symbolic models.Higher-level analyses of these connectionist models reveal subtle relations to symbolic models. Parallel connectionist memory and linguistic processes are hypothesized to give rise to processes that are describable at a higher level as sequential rule application. At the lower level, computation has the character of massively parallel satisfaction of soft numerical constraints; at the higher level, this can lead to competence characterizable by hard rules. Performance will typically deviate from this competence since behavior is achieved not by interpreting hard rules but by satisfying soft constraints. The result is a picture in which traditional and connectionist theoretical constructs collaborate intimately to provide an understanding of cognition.},

The origins of contemporary confusions over the term `nomothetic' stem from a long-held misconception that nomothetic research requires large samples and group-based statistics such as means and variances (i.e. the `Galtonian' paradigm), when in fact nomothetic research has another paradigm at its disposal that can be termed the `Wundtian' paradigm, which relies on smaller samples, and a case-by-case form of analysis (Lamiell, 2003). Meanwhile, the historical origins of confusion over the term `idiographic' stem from an enduring but incorrect sense that it is opposed to nomothetic inquiry, combined with an increasing tendency to use the word in ways that bear no relation to its original meaning. The contemporary situation could be substantially improved if Psychology was to re-locate the Wundtian model back to its rightful central position in the discipline.},

  shorttitle = {The Circumplex Model of Affect},
  abstract = {The circumplex model of affect proposes that all affective states
arise from cognitive interpretations of core neural sensations that are
the product of two independent neurophysiological systems. This model
stands in contrast to theories of basic emotions, which posit that a
discrete and independent neural system subserves every emotion. We propose
that basic emotion theories no longer explain adequately the vast number
of empirical observations from studies in affective neuroscience, and we
suggest that a conceptual shift is needed in the empirical approaches
taken to the study of emotion and affective psychopathologies. The
circumplex model of affect is more consistent with many recent findings
from behavioral, cognitive neuroscience, neuroimaging, and developmental
studies of affect. Moreover, the model offers new theoretical and
empirical approaches to studying the development of affective disorders as
well as the genetic and cognitive underpinnings of affective processing
within the central nervous system.This work

A characterization of the nature of phenomena is given, and the process of their detection is briefly described in terms of a multistage model of data analysis. The construction of explanatory theories is shown to involve their generation through abductive, or explanatory, reasoning, their development through analogical modeling, and their fuller appraisal in terms of judgments of the best of competing explanations.

Without consensual conceptualization and operationalization of exactly what phenomenon is to be studied, progress in theory and research is difficult to achieve and fruitless debates are likely to proliferate. A particularly unfortunate example is William James's asking the question ``What is an emotion?'' when he really meant ``feeling'', a misnomer that started a debate which is still ongoing, more than a century later. This contribution attempts to sensitize researchers in the social and behavioral sciences to the importance of definitional issues and their consequences for distinguishing related but fundamentally different affective processes, states, and traits.

I argue that theories of emotion causation should ideally address the problems of elicitation, intensity, and differentiation. Each of these problems can be divided into a subquestion that asks about the relation between stimuli and emotions (i.e., the functional level of process description, cf. Marr, 1982) and a subquestion that asks about the mechanism and representations that intervene (i.e., the algorithmic level of process description). The overview reveals that theories of emotion causation sometimes differ with regard to the kind of process that they hold responsible for emotion causation. More precisely, they hold different assumptions regarding the conditions under which the process is supposed to operate (optimal versus suboptimal), the format of the representations involved (propositional versus perceptual), and the object or input of the central process (stimulus versus responses/experience). Further, the overview reveals that theories of emotion causation sometimes differ with regard to the level of process description that they focus on. Finally, the overview brings to light several similarities among the theories discussed.},

  abstract = {Factor-analytic evidence has led most psychologists to describe affect as a set of dimensions, such as displeasure, distress, depression, excitement, and so on, with each dimension varying independently of the others. However, there is other evidence that rather than being independent, these affective dimensions are interrelated in a highly systematic fashion. The evidence suggests that these interrelationships can be represented by a spatial model in which affective concepts fall in a circle in the following order: pleasure (0), excitement (45), arousal (90), distress (135), displeasure (180), depression (225), sleepiness (270), and relaxation (315). This model was offered both as a way psychologists can represent the structure of affective experience, as assessed through self-report, and as a representation of the cognitive structure that laymen utilize in conceptualizing affect. Supportive evidence was obtained by scaling 28 emotion-denoting adjectives in 4 different ways: R. T. Ross's (1938) technique for a circular ordering of variables, a multidimensional scaling procedure based on perceived similarity among the terms, a unidimensional scaling on hypothesized pleasure\textendash{}displeasure and degree-of-arousal dimensions, and a principal-components analysis of 343 Ss' self-reports of their current affective states.

They are adopted by researchers in social science, particularly in the analysis of performance or attitudinal data, in psychology, education, medicine, marketing and other fields where the aim is to measure latent constructs. Most IRT analyses use parametric models that rely on assumptions that often are not satisfied. In such cases, a nonparametric approach might be preferable; nevertheless, there are not many software applications allowing to use that. To address this gap, this paper presents the R package KernSmoothIRT. It implements kernel smoothing for the estimation of option characteristic curves, and adds several plotting and analytical tools to evaluate the whole test/questionnaire, the items, and the subjects. In order to show the package's capabilities, two real datasets are used, one employing multiple-choice responses, and the other scaled responses.},

  abstract = {This paper undertakes a systematic assessment of the extent to which factor analysis the correct number of latent dimensions (factors) when applied to ordered-categorical survey items (so-called Likert items). We simulate 2400 data sets of uni-dimensional Likert items that vary systematically over a range of conditions such as the underlying population distribution, the number of items, the level of random error, and characteristics of items and item-sets. Each of these datasets is factor analysed in a variety of ways that are frequently used in the extant literature, or that are recommended in current methodological texts. These include exploratory factor retention heuristics such as Kaiser's criterion, Parallel Analysis and a non-graphical scree test, and (for exploratory and confirmatory analyses) evaluations of model fit. These analyses are conducted on the basis of Pearson and polychoric correlations. We find that, irrespective of the particular mode of analysis, factor analysis applied to ordered-categorical survey data very often leads to over-dimensionalisation. The magnitude of this risk depends on the specific way in which factor analysis is conducted, the number of items, the properties of the set of items, and the underlying population distribution. The paper concludes with a discussion of the consequences of over-dimensionalisation, and a brief mention of alternative modes of analysis that are much less prone to such problems.},

  abstract = {This study tested whether the structure of affect observed on the basis of between-person (BP) differences is equivalent to the affect structures that organize the variability of affective states within persons (WP) over time. Further aims were to identify individual differences in the degree of divergence between the WP and BP structure and examine its association to dispositional and contextual variables (neuroticism, extraversion, well-being and stress). In 100 daily sessions, 101 younger adults rated their mood on the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. Variability of five negative affect items across time was so low that they were excluded from the analyses. We thus worked with a modified negative affect subscale. WP affect structures diverged reliably from the BP structure, with individual differences in the degree of divergence. Differences in the WP structural characteristics and the degree of divergence could be predicted by well-being and stress. We conclude that BP and WP structures of affect are not equivalent and that BP and WP variation should be considered as distinct phenomena. It would be wrong, for example, to conceive of positive and negative affect as independent at the WP level, as suggested by BP findings. Yet, individual differences in WP structural characteristics are related to stable BP differences, and the degree to which individuals' affect structures diverge from the BP structure can provide important insights into intraindividual functioning.

  abstract = {We address the question of equivalence between modeling results obtained on intra-individual and inter-individual levels of psychometric analysis. Our focus is on the concept of measurement invariance and the role it may play in this context. We discuss this in general against the background of the latent variable paradigm, complemented by an operational demonstration in terms of a linear state-space model, i.e., a time series model with latent variables. Implemented in a multiple-occasion and multiple-subject setting, the model simultaneously accounts for intra-individual and inter-individual differences. We consider the conditions \textendash{} in terms of invariance constraints \textendash{} under which modeling results are generalizable (a) over time within subjects, (b) over subjects within occasions, and (c) over time and subjects simultaneously thus implying an equivalence-relationship between both dimensions. Since we distinguish the measurement model from the structural model governing relations between the latent variables of interest, we decompose the invariance constraints into those that involve structural parameters and those that involve measurement parameters and relate to measurement invariance. Within the resulting taxonomy of models, we show that, under the condition of measurement invariance over time and subjects, there exists a form of structural equivalence between levels of analysis that is distinct from full structural equivalence, i.e., ergodicity. We demonstrate how measurement invariance between and within subjects can be tested in the context of high-frequency repeated measures in personality research. Finally, we discuss problems of measurement variance in relation to problems of non-ergodicity as currently discussed and approached in the literature.},

In contrast, much of applied psychology is concerned with the analysis of variation within individuals. Furthermore, the mechanisms specified by psychological theories generally operate within, rather than across, individuals. This disconnect between research practice, applied demands, and psychological theories constitutes a major threat to the conceptual integrity of the field. Following groundbreaking earlier work, we propose a conceptual framework that distinguishes within-person (WP) and between-person (BP) sources of variation in psychological constructs. By simultaneously considering both sources of variation, it is shown how to identify possible reasons for nonequivalence of BP and WP structures as well as establishing areas of convergence. For this purpose, we first introduce the concept of conditional equivalence as a way to study partial structural equivalence of BP and WP structures in the presence of unconditional nonequivalence. Second, we demonstrate the construction of likelihood planes to explore the causes of structural nonequivalence. Third, we examine 4 common causes for unconditional nonequivalence\textemdash{}autoregression, subgroup differences, linear trends, and cyclic trends\textemdash{}and demonstrate how to account for them. Fourth, we provide an empirical example on BP and WP differences in attentiveness.},

Some of these critiques of content, methodology, relevance, and philosophical worldview have actually influenced and become integrated into the canon; others pose moral questions still under debate. All are accessibly presented so that readers may judge their value for themselves: - Kant's critique of rational and empirical psychology at the end of the 18th century - The natural-scientific critique of philosophical psychology in the 19th century - The human-scientific critique of natural-scientific psychology - The Marxist traditions of critique - Feminist and postmodern critiques and the contemporary mainstream - Postcolonial critiques and the shift from cross-cultural to multicultural psychology This is not a book of critique for critique's sake: Teo defines the field as a work in progress with goals that are evolving yet constant. In emphasizing ethical and political questions faced by psychology as a discipline, this visionary book points students, academics, and practitioners toward new possibilities for their shared future.},

  abstract = {Nesselroade, Gerstorf, Hardy, and Ram (this issue) propose to "filter out" idiosyncrasies of dynamic processes at the level of the individual through the application of dynamic factor analysis. The problem that they deal with is that individuals may differ in the items that are "salient" for a given construct, so that the same measurement model does not hold across subjects. The proposed method, however, allows for the same constructs to be measured by different items in different subjects, and therefore appears to bypass this problem. Nesselroade et al. accomplish this by first estimating a dynamic factor model for each individual, where the item-factor relations are free to vary across subjects, and then executing a higher order analysis in which the factor intercorrelations are required to be identical across subjects. They motivate this procedure partly by appealing to the literature on measurement invariance; the only difference, in their own words, is that they define "invariance at the level of construct interrelations rather than at the level of construct-observables relations."},

However, many psychological methods do not cope well, either at the level of construct definition or at the level of measurement, with individuality in behavior. There is little leeway for constructs to be both idiosyncratically tailored to the individual, and still identified as having the same core meaning between individuals. Generally accepted ways to aggregate data in the course of empirically studying relationships simply ignore idiosyncrasy\textendash{}but do so at some as yet undetermined costs. We identify, and illustrate with empirical data, the main features of an individually-oriented approach to general construct definition and measurement that seem to challenge the established concepts and norms of "good" measurement practice in behavioral research yet, at the same time, can be reconciled with them.},

  abstract = {Two of the most important traditions of quantitative research in sociology and social psychology are those of survey research and laboratory or field experiments. In the former, the explicit objective is usually that of generalizing to some specific population, whereas in the latter it is more often that of stating relationships among variables. These two objectives are not thought to be incompatible in any fundamental sense, but nevertheless we lack a clear understanding of their interrelationship.One of the most frequent objections to laboratory experiments turns on the question of generalizability, or what Campbell and Stanley refer to as ``external validity.'' In essence, this question seems to reduce to at least two related problems: (1) that of representativeness or typicality, and (2) the possibility of interaction effects that vary with experimental conditions. In the first case, the concern would seem to be with central tendency and dispersion of single variables, that is, whether the means and standard deviations of variables in the experimental situation are sufficiently close to those of some larger population. The second involves the question of possible disturbing influences introduced into the experimental setting that produce non-additive effects when combined with either the experimental variable or the premeasurement. These same variables may of course be operative in larger populations. But presumably they take on different numerical values, with the result that one would infer different relationships between major independent and dependent variables in the two kinds of research settings.},

The author therefore proposes that a clear distinction be maintained between differential psychology and personality psychology and that individual differences research be recognized as relevant to the concerns of the former. An alternative to the individual differences paradigm, termed idiothetic, is suggested as a general framework for the scientific study of personality. Within this framework, the basic problem of personality description would be approached in an explicitly idiographic manner, while the search for nomothetic principles would center around questions of personality development.

In the course of evaluating this proposal, Windelband's distinction is placed within the broader context of the neo-Kantian understanding of science, history and philosophy, and briefly contrasted with Dilthey's epistemological distinction between the human and natural sciences which takes psychology, and our understanding of individual persons, as belonging to the human, which is to say, historical sciences.},

In this respect the development of the dichotomy of nomothetic and idiographic methodology from its generally forgotten neo-Kantian origins (Windelband, Rickert, Natorp, Bauch, M{\"u}nch, Hessen, M{\"u}nsterberg) is delineated within the context of a historical-philosophical analysis and then its incorporation into psychology and psychopathology (Stern, Binswanger, Kronfeld, Jaspers) is reconstructed. In the course of this analysis and also in the discussion of the currently accepted theories of analytical philosophy (Stegm{\"u}ller) and critical rationalism (Popper) it becomes clear that, in spite of widespread current opinions to the contrary, individualizing concept formation is an indispensable element in the methodological inventory of psychiatric science.},

Transfer assessment included multiple tests of PS, WM, EM, and reasoning. In both age groups, reliable positive transfer was found not only for individual tests but also for cognitive abilities, represented as latent factors. Furthermore, the pattern of correlations between latent change factors of practiced and latent change factors of transfer tasks indicates systematic relations at the level of broad abilities, making the interpretation of effects as resulting from unspecific increases in motivation or self-concept less likely.},

Measurements were based on a total pool of 75 adjectives culled from the literature to represent eight dimensions of affect established in primarily cross-sectional studies. The data were analyzed in a P-technique factor analysis context to determine both the extent to which interindividual differences and intraindividual variability concepts were interchangeable and how general such intraindividual variability concepts were among different subjects. Although evidence was found that subjects construe many adjectives differently, for dimensions such as Energy, Well Being, Fatigue, and Concentration, the data indicate that cross-sectionally and longitudinally based personality concepts exhibit a fair degree of convergence.},

  abstract = {In the technical literature of computer science, the concept of an effective procedure is closely associated with the notion of an instruction that precisely specifies an action. Turing machine instructions are held up as providing paragons of instructions that "precisely describe" or "well define" the actions they prescribe. Numerical algorithms and computer programs are judged effective just insofar as they are thought to be translatable into Turing machine programs. Nontechnical procedures (e.g., recipes, methods) are summarily dismissed as ineffective on the grounds that their instructions lack the requisite precision. But despite the pivotal role played by the notion of a precisely specified instruction in classifying procedures as effective and ineffective, little attention has been paid to the manner in which instructions "precisely specify" the actions they prescribe. It is the purpose of this paper to remedy this defect. The results are startling. The reputed exemplary precision of Turing machine instructions turns out to be a myth. Indeed, the most precise specifications of action are provided not by the procedures of theoretical computer science and mathematics (algorithms) but rather by the nontechnical procedures of everyday life. I close with a discussion of some of the rumifications of these conclusions for understanding and designing concrete computers and their programming languages.},

  abstract = {A biologically inspired cognitive architecture must draw its insights from what is known from animal (including human) cognition. Such architectures should faithfully model the high-level modules and processes of cognitive neuroscience. Also, biologically inspired cognitive architectures are expected to contribute to the BICA "challenge of creating a real-life computational equivalent of the human mind" One unified theory of cognition, Global Workspace Theory (GWT) has emerged as the most widely accepted, empirically supported theory of the role of consciousness in cognition. Recent experimental studies reveal rich cortical connectivity capable of supporting a large-scale dynamic network. We propose that brains in fact cyclically and dynamically form such a network according to GWT. The biologically inspired LIDA cognitive architecture implements GWT conceptually and computationally. Here we argue that the LIDA architecture's breadth, flexible motivations using feelings, explicit attention mechanism, and continual, incremental and online learning in several modalities provide a significant first step in the direction of the BICA challenge. We also measure LIDA against the architectural features listed in the BICA Table of Implemented Cognitive Architectures. Applying recent brain connectivity results, we go on to elucidate the relationship between LIDA and the underlying and motivating neuroscience, using the language of non-linear dynamics. In particular, we claim that LIDA's representations correspond to basins of attraction in the non-linear dynamics of neural activation patterns. In addition, we claim that the rhythms of LIDA's cognitive cycle and of its internal cognitive elements have definite psychophysiological corollaries in the oscillatory patterns observed in the human brain. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  issn = {00100277},
  abstract = {The subject of this article is the frame problem, as conceived by certain cognitive scientists and philosophers of mind, notably Fodor for whom it stands as a fundamental obstacle to progress in cognitive science. The challenge is to explain the capacity of so-called informationally unencapsulated cognitive processes to deal effectively with information from potentially any cognitive domain without the burden of having to explicitly sift the relevant from the irrelevant. The paper advocates a global workspace architecture, with its ability to manage massively parallel resources in the context of a serial thread of computation, as an answer to this challenge. Analogical reasoning is given particular attention, since it exemplifies informational unencapsulation in its most extreme form. Because global workspace theory also purports to account for the distinction between conscious and unconscious information processing, the paper advances the tentative conclusion that consciousness may go hand-in-hand with a solution to the frame problem in the biological brain. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  title = {The Rise of Machine Consciousness: {{Studying}} Consciousness with Computational Models},
  volume = {44},
  issn = {08936080},
  abstract = {Efforts to create computational models of consciousness have accelerated over the last two decades, creating a field that has become known as artificial consciousness. There have been two main motivations for this controversial work: to develop a better scientific understanding of the nature of human/animal consciousness and to produce machines that genuinely exhibit conscious awareness. This review begins by briefly explaining some of the concepts and terminology used by investigators working on machine consciousness, and summarizes key neurobiological correlates of human consciousness that are particularly relevant to past computational studies. Models of consciousness developed over the last twenty years are then surveyed. These models are largely found to fall into five categories based on the fundamental issue that their developers have selected as being most central to consciousness: a global workspace, information integration, an internal self-model, higher-level representations, or attention mechanisms. For each of these five categories, an overview of past work is given, a representative example is presented in some detail to illustrate the approach, and comments are provided on the contributions and limitations of the methodology. Three conclusions are offered about the state of the field based on this review: (1) computational modeling has become an effective and accepted methodology for the scientific study of consciousness, (2) existing computational models have successfully captured a number of neurobiological, cognitive, and behavioral correlates of conscious information processing as machine simulations, and (3) no existing approach to artificial consciousness has presented a compelling demonstration of phenomenal machine consciousness, or even clear evidence that artificial phenomenal consciousness will eventually be possible. The paper concludes by discussing the importance of continuing work in this area, considering the ethical issues it raises, and making predictions concerning future developments. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Objective: Consciousness is often thought to be that aspect of mind that is least amenable to being understood or replicated by artificial intelligence (AI). The first-personal, subjective, what-it-is-like-to-be-something nature of consciousness is thought to be untouchable by the computations, algorithms, processing and functions of AI method. Since AI is the most promising avenue toward artificial consciousness (AC), the conclusion many draw is that AC is even more doomed than AI supposedly is. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the soundness of this inference. Methods: The results are achieved by means of conceptual analysis and argumentation. Results and conclusions: It is shown that pessimism concerning the theoretical possibility of artificial consciousness is unfounded, based as it is on misunderstandings of AI, and a lack of awareness of the possible roles AI might play in accounting for or reproducing consciousness. This is done by making some foundational distinctions relevant to AC, and using them to show that some common reasons given for AC scepticism do not touch some of the (usually neglected) possibilities for AC, such as prosthetic, discriminative, practically necessary, and lagom (necessary-but-not-sufficient) AC. Along the way three strands of the author's work in AC - interactive empiricism, synthetic phenomenology, and ontologically conservative heterophenomenology - are used to illustrate and motivate the distinctions and the defences of AC they make possible. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Research has shown the localization of mental functions in regions of the brain, the interaction of cognition and emotion, and the importance of social interaction in evolutionary history and child development. 3. Artificial intelligence. Some forms of robotics use embodied systems that learn by interacting with their environment, but the possibilities for emotion, socialization, and consciousness in robots remain problematic. 4. Relations between levels. Concepts that can help us relate studies of neurons and persons include the hierarchy of levels, the communication of information, the behavior of dynamic systems, and epistemological and ontological emergence. 5. Philosophy of mind. Two-aspect theories of the mind-brain relation offer an alternative between the extremes of eliminative materialism and the thesis that consciousness is irreducible. 6. Process philosophy. I suggest that process thought provides a coherent philosophical framework in which these themes can be brought together. It combines dipolar monism with organizational pluralism, and it emphasizes embodiment, emotions, a hierarchy of levels, and the social character of selfhood.},

The basic form of consciousness, core consciousness is placed in the context of life regulation; it is seen as yet another level of biological processing aimed at ensuring the homeostatic balance of a living organism; and the representation of the current organism state within somato-sensing structures is seen as critical to its development. Core consciousness is conceived as the imaged relationship of the interaction between an object and the changed organism state it causes. In the second part of the article we discuss the functional neuroanatomy of nuclei in the brainstem reticular formation because they constitute the basic set of somato-sensing structures necessary for core consciousness and its core self to emerge. The close relationship between the mechanisms underlying cortical activation and the bioregulatory mechanisms outlined here is entirely compatible with the classical idea that the reticular formation modulates the electrophysiological activity of the cerebral cortex.

In this paper, a partial implementation of the Cognitive Decathlon is described using the Psy-chology Experiment Building Language (PEBL). The tasks focus not simply on generic human abilities, but on critical skills that highlight aspects of human performance that are at odds with common arti\textasciimacron{}cial intelligence approaches. The di\textregistered{}erences between human and algorithmic behavior in such tasks can reveal properties of the human cognitive architecture, and production of similar behavior by arti\textasciimacron{}cial systems can help constrain and validate biologically-inspired systems. 1. Retrospective and Re\textdegree{}ection on the BICA Cognitive Decathlon The Cognitive Decathlon was developed as a test plan during the initial stage of DARPA's Biologically-Inspired Cognitive Architectures (BICA) program. Although a full research program was not funded following that initial stage, the e\textregistered{}ort none-theless fostered numerous collaborations that have already begun to bear fruit. The goals of the original Cognitive Decathlon were centered on the particular needs and motivations of BICA (see Mueller et al. [2006] for a detailed description), which aimed to develop embodied biologically-inspired cognitive agents and robots. Thus, the test was targeted toward a somewhat lower skill level than had it been designed for no-holds-barred arti\textasciimacron{}cial intelligence, see [Mueller and Minnery, 2008], but it still encompassed a broad and useful range of target skills. Although the original e\textregistered{}ort did not result in testable empirical methodologies, it assembled a plan for testing a broad set of skills that could serve as a target for future researchers developing general human-level arti\textasciimacron{}cial intelligence. In the time since, subsequent researchers have suggested ways in which the Decathlon might be revised using factor-analytic approach to human intelligence},

Given that matter is organized on a range of levels in time and space, this generic stance must be further constrained by a principled choice of levels on which the posited structure is supposed to reside. Indeed, not only must the formal structure fit well the physical system that realizes it, but it must do so in a manner that is determined by the system itself, simply because the mental life of a machine cannot be up to an external observer. To illustrate just how tall this order is, we carefully analyze the scenario in which a digital computer simulates a network of neurons. We show that the formal correspondence between the two systems thereby established is at best partial, and, furthermore, that it is fundamentally incapable of realizing both some of the essential properties of actual neuronal systems and some of the fundamental properties of experience. Our analysis suggests that, if machine consciousness is at all possible, conscious experience can only be instantiated in a class of machines that are entirely different from digital computers, namely, time-continuous, open, analog dynamical systems.},

  abstract = {Not all research in machine consciousness aims to instantiate phenomenal states in artefacts. For example, one can use artefacts that do not themselves have phenomenal states, merely to simulate or model organisms that do. Nevertheless, one might refer to all of these pursuits \textemdash{} instantiating, simulating or modelling phe- nomenal states in an artefact \textemdash{} as `synthetic phenomenality'.1 But there is another way in which artificial agents (be they simulated or real) may play a crucial role in understanding or creating conscious- ness: `synthetic phenomenology'.2 Explanations involving specific experiential events require ameans of specifying the contents of experi- ence; not all of them can be specified linguistically. One alternative, at least for the case of visual experience, is to use depictions that either evoke or refer to the content of the experience. Practical con- siderations concerning the generation and integration of such depic- tions argue in favour of a synthetic approach: the generation of depictions through the use of an embodied, perceiving and acting agent, either virtual or real. Synthetic phenomenology, then, is the attempt to use the states, interactions and capacities of an artificial agent for the purpose of specifying the contents of conscious experi- ence. This paper takes the first steps toward seeing how one might use a robot to specify the non-conceptual content of the visual experience of an (hypothetical) organism that the robot models.},

On the examples of comparison of the evoked potentials with a theory of signal identification (A.M. Ivanitskii) and need-informational theory of emotions (P.V. Simonov) with the "general low of human emotions" (D. Price, J. Barrell) is demonstrated the efficiency of the simultaneous study of the higher brain functions by neurophysiological and psychological methods. Recent experimental data are underlied by the natural-scientific bases of consciousness. From the author's point of view consciousness is knowledge, which by means of words, mathematical symbols and artistic images may be shared with other individuals, with other generations in a form of cultural monuments. Recent studies by O. Grindel' have shown that preservation of connections between the gnostic cortical areas with the verbal brain structures is a necessary condition of consciousness functioning. The subconsciousness is well automatized and because of that no longer conscious skills, well learned social norms controlling behaviour and experienced as "the voice of heart", "the call of duty" etc. Super-Ego by Freud belongs to the subconscious sphere of the psychic. The superconsciousness (creative intuition) is an initial stage of a creative venture, uncontrolled by consciousness and will: initial closing of new temporary connections (whether they conform to the reality or not is defined only later). Actual controversy between determinism and freedom of choice may be removed by the complementation principle. The man is not free (determined) from the point of view of an external observer, who considers the determination of the man by genetic factors and educational conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

This paper presents a novel artificial consciousness scale designed to provide a pragmatic and intuitive reference in the evaluation of MC implementations. The version of ConsScale described in this work provides a comprehensive evaluation mechanism which enables the estimation of the potential degree of consciousness of most of the existing artificial implementations. This scale offers both well defined levels of artificial consciousness (that can be used for qualitative classification of agents) and a method to calculate an orientative numerical score (which provides a quantitative grade for comparing agents in terms of consciousness). A set of architectural and cognitive criteria is considered for each level of the scale. This permits the definition of a cognitive framework in which MC implementations can be ranked according to their potential capability to reproduce functional synergies associated with consciousness. The probability of the implementations having any phenomenal states related to the assessed functional synergy is not specifically addressed in this paper; nevertheless, it could be thoughtfully discussed elsewhere.},

In this paper, we focus on the functional aspects of consciousness and propose the application of a revision of ConsScale - a biologically inspired scale for measuring cognitive development in artificial agents - in order to assess the cognitive capabilities of machine consciousness implementations. We argue that the progress in the implementation of consciousness in artificial agents can be assessed by looking at how key cognitive abilities associated to consciousness are integrated within artificial systems. Specifically, we characterize ConsScale as a partially ordered set and propose a particular dependency hierarchy for cognitive skills. Associated to that hierarchy a graphical representation of the cognitive profile of an artificial agent is presented as a helpful analytic tool. The proposed evaluation schema is discussed and applied to a number of significant machine consciousness models and implementations. Finally, the possibility of generating qualia and phenomenological states in machines is discussed in the context of the proposed analysis. \textcopyright{} 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

This paper argues that the possible actions might best be represented by interactions between a model of reality and a model of the agent, and that, in such an arrangement, the internal model of the agent might be a transparent model of the sort recently discussed by Metzinger, and so might offer a useful analogue of a conscious entity. The CRONOS project has built a robot functionally similar to a human that has been provided with an internal model of itself and of the world to be used in the way suggested by Craik; when the system is completed, it will be possible to study its operation from the perspective not only of artificial intelligence, but also of machine consciousness.},

  abstract = {This paper relates to a formal statement of the mechanisms that are thought minimally necessary to underpin consciousness. This is expressed in the form of axioms. We deem this to be useful if there is ever to be clarity in answering questions about whether this or the other organism is or is not conscious. As usual, axioms are ways of making formal statements of intuitive beliefs and looking, again formally, at the consequences of such beliefs. The use of this style of exposition does not entail a claim to provide a mathematically rigorous formal deductive system. Conventional mathematical notation is used to achieve clarity, although this is elaborated with natural language in an attempt to reduce terseness. In our view, making the approach axiomatic is synonymous with building clear usable tests for consciousness and is therefore a central feature of the paper. The extended scope of this approach is to lay down some essential properties that should be considered when designing machines that could be said to be conscious. In the broader discussion about the nature of consciousness and its neurological mechanisms, it may seem to some that axiomatisation is premature and continues to beg many questions. However, the approach is meant to be open- ended so that others can build further axiomatic clarifications that address the very large number of questions which, in the search for a formal basis for consciousness, still remain to be answered. Of course, in discussions about consciousness many will also argue that the subject is not one that may ever be formally addressed by means of axioms. The view taken in this paper is 'let's try to do it and see how far it gets'.},

Digital computers are built from electronic circuits whose parts can be in one of two states, typically encoded as voltages. These are often called bits.

Developments of Baars' Global Workspace theory over the past decade are examples of this progress. Integrating experimental data and models from cognitive psychology, AI and neuroscience, we present a neurocognitive model in which consciousness is defined as a global integration and dissemination system nested in a large-scale, distributed array of specialized bioprocessors which controls the allocation of the processing resources of the central nervous system. It is posited that this global control is effected via conical 'gating' of a strategic thalamic nucleus. The basic circuitry of this neural system is reasonably well understood, and can be modeled to a first approximation, employing neural network principles.},

The book ranges widely, starting with an account of how the processes that support consciousness in the brain have become increasingly open to experimental study, giving a fresh analysis of the extent of pre-conscious/ unconscious processing, moving on to suggest what consciousness is good for when it appears, how to detect its presence by use of third-person observable neurophysiological signatures, incorporating these signatures into a version of the currently popular 'global workspace model' of consciousness-and finally, suggesting some clinical applications of the emerging research and some speculations about new frontiers, for example how the emerging science might be applied to the assessment of consciousness in babies and non-human animals.

Proponents of Mind-Body Type-Identity theories have claimed that mental states can be reduced to neurophysiological states of the brain. Others have denied that such a reduction is possible; for them, there remains an explanatory gap. In this paper, functionalist, physicalist, epiphenomenalist, and biological models of the mind are discussed and compared. Donald Davidson's Anomalous Monism is proposed as a unifying framework for a non-reductive theory of qualia and consciousness.

I describe three alternative, non-symbolic approaches, each with a different em- phasis but all using the same underlying computational model. This is a network of interacting computing units, a unit representing a nerve cell to a greater or lesser degree of fidelity in the different approaches. Computational neuroscience emphasizes the development and functioning of the nervous system; the approach of neural networks examines new algorithms for specific applications in, for ex- ample, pattern recognition and classification; according to the sub-symbolic ap- proach, concepts are built up of entities called sub-symbols, which are the activ- ities of individual processing units in a neural network. A frequently debated question is whether theories formulated at the sub- symbolic level are 'mere implementations' of symbolic ones. I describe recent work due to Foster, who proposes that it is valid to view a system at many differ- ent levels of description and that, whereas any theory may have many different implementations, in general sub-symbolic theories may not be implementations of symbolic ones.},

  abstract = {In this work, we present a distributed cognitive architecture used to control the traffic in an urban network. This architecture relies on a machine consciousness approach - Global Workspace Theory - in order to use competition and broadcast, allowing a group of local traffic controllers to interact, resulting in a better group performance. The main idea is that the local controllers usually perform a purely reactive behavior, defining the times of red and green lights, according just to local information. These local controllers compete in order to define which of them is experiencing the most critical traffic situation. The controller in the worst condition gains access to the global workspace, further broadcasting its condition (and its location) to all other controllers, asking for their help in dealing with its situation. This call from the controller accessing the global workspace will cause an interference in the reactive local behavior, for those local controllers with some chance in helping the controller in a critical condition, by containing traffic in its direction. This group behavior, coordinated by the global workspace strategy, turns the once reactive behavior into a kind of deliberative one. We show that this strategy is capable of improving the overall mean travel time of vehicles flowing through the urban network. A consistent gain in performance with the "Artificial Consciousness" traffic signal controller during all simulation time, throughout different simulated scenarios, could be observed, ranging from around 13.8\% to more than 21\%.},

A progeny of late 19th-century pathology and microbiology, and the clinical discipline of infectious diseases, immunology did not attain a formal theoretical construction until after World War II, when ``the self'' was introduced to provide a ready and convenient metaphor for deciphering immune reactivity. In the original formulation, normally, host constituents are ignored by the immune system, while ``the other''\textemdash{}pathogens, foreign substances, altered host elements\textemdash{}are processed and destroyed. By the late 1970s, ``the self'' became the foundation of immune theorizing, and immunology dubbed itself the science of ``self/non-self discrimination.'' But this dominant model has recently been challenged, for the self is polymorphous and ill-defined. Contemporary transplantation biology and autoimmunity have demonstrated phenomena that fail to allow strict adherence to such a dichotomy of self/non-self, and as new models are emerging, ``the self'' has been left exposed as a metaphor, whose grounding\textemdash{}philosophically and scientifically\textemdash{}is unsteady and thus increasingly elusive as the putative nexus of immunology's doctrines.},

We advance an alternative hypothesis \textendash{} consciousness is the hallmark of a fundamental way to organise causal interactions between an agent and its environment. Thus consciousness is not a special property or an addition to the cognitive processes, but rather the way in which the causal structure of the body of the agent is causally entangled with a world of physical causes. The advantage of this hypothesis is that it suggests how to exploit causal coupling to envisage tentative guidelines for designing conscious artificial agents. In this paper, we outline the key characteristics of these causal building blocks and then a set of standard technologies that may take advantage of such an approach. Consciousness is modelled as a kind of cognitive middle ground and experience is not an internal by-product of cognitive processes but the external world that is carved out by means of causal interaction. Thus, consciousness is not the penthouse on top of a 50 stores cognitive skyscraper, but the way in which the steel girders snap together from bottom to top.},

Although an operational definition of consciousness has not yet been developed, philosophy has come to identify a set of features and aspects that are thought to be associated with the various elements of consciousness. On the other hand, there have been several recent attempts to develop computational models of consciousness that are claimed to capture or illustrate one or more aspects of consciousness. As a plausible substitute to evaluating how well the current computational models model consciousness, this study examines how the current computational models fare in modeling those aspects and features of consciousness identified by philosophy. Following a review of the literature on the philosophy of consciousness, this study constructs a list of features and aspects that would be expected in any successful model of consciousness. The study then evaluates, from the viewpoint of that list, some of the current self-claimed and implemented computational models of consciousness. The computational models studied are evaluated with respect to each identified aspect and feature of consciousness. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

  abstract = {What type of artificial systems will claim to be conscious and will claim to experience qualia? The ability to comment upon physical states of a brain-like dynamical system coupled with its environment seems to be sufficient to make claims. The flow of internal states in such systems, guided and limited by associative memory, is similar to the stream of consciousness. A specific architecture of an artificial system, termed articon, is introduced that by its very design has to claim being conscious. Non-verbal discrimination of the working memory states of the articon gives it the ability to experience different qualities of internal states. Analysis of the flow of inner states of such a system during typical behavioral process shows that qualia are inseparable from perception and action. The role of consciousness in learning of skills \textendash{} when conscious information processing is replaced by subconscious \textendash{} is elucidated. Arguments confirming that phenomenal experience is a result of cognitive processes are presented. Possible philosophical objections based on the Chinese room and other arguments are discussed, but they are insufficient to refute articon's claims that it is conscious. Conditions for genuine understanding that go beyond the Turing test are presented. Articons may fulfill such conditions and in principle the structure of their experiences may be arbitrarily close to human.

  abstract = {Do infants perceive visual cues as diverse as frontal-view faces, profiles or bodies as being different aspects of the same object, a fellow human? If that is the case, visual exposure to one such cue should facilitate the subsequent processing of the others. To verify this hypothesis, we recorded event-related responses in 4-month-old infants and in adults. Pictures of eyes were interleaved amongst images belonging to three human contexts (frontal-view faces, profiles or bodies) or non-human contexts (houses, cars or pliers). In adults, both profile and frontal-face contexts elicited suppression of the N170 response to eye pictures, indicating an access to a view-invariant representation of faces. In infants, a response suppression of the N290 component was recorded only in the context of frontal faces, while profile context induces a different effect (i.e., a P400 enhancement) on eye processing. This dissociation suggests that the view-invariant representation of faces is learned, as it is for other 3-D objects and needs more than 4 months of exposure to be established. In a follow-up study, where infants were exposed to a short movie showing people rotating their heads, the profile-induced P400 effect was speeded up, indicating that exposure to successive views of the same object is probably a way to build up adult-like face representations. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The work I review jointly supports the conclusion that a ``core-circuit'' of interacting cortical regions \textendash{} the global workspace network \textendash{} can be understood as a unified system for consciously perceiving and deciding, and thus fulfills many of the roles intuitively assigned to the self.

The approach is mostly `analytic' in style and draws on important recent work in cognitive science, perception, artificial intelligence, neuropsychology and psychopathology.

After briefly illustrating why and how phenomenal consciousness is puzzling, we propose a theoretical diagnosis of the problem and present a framework within which further research would yield a solution. Our diagnosis is that the puzzle stems from a peculiar dual epistemic access to phenomenal aspects (qualia) of our conscious experiences. We present an account of concept formation such that both the phenomenal concepts (like the concepts, RED and SWEET) and the introspective concepts (like the concepts, EXPERIENCING RED and TASTING SWEET) are acquired from a first-person perspective as opposed to the third-person one (the standard concept formation strategy about objective features).

I assume this is an empirical fact about the actual causal relations between mental processes and brains. It says simply that certain brain processes are sufficient for intentionality. (2) Instantiating a computer program is never by itself a sufficient condition of intentionality. The main argument of this paper is directed at establishing this claim. The form of the argument is to show how a human agent could instantiate the program and still not have the relevant intentionality. These two propositions have the following consequences: (3) The explanation of how the brain produces intentionality cannot be that it by instantiating a computer program. This is a strict logical consequence of 41 and 2 (4) Any mechanism capable of producing intentionality must have causal powers equal to those of the brain. This is meant to be a trivial consequence of 1 (5) Any attempt literally to create intentionality artificially (strong Al) could not succeed just by designing programs but would have to duplicate the causal louvers of the human brain. This follows from 2 and 4."Could a machine think?" On the argument advanced here only a machine could think, and only very special kinds of machines, namely brains and machines with internal causal powers equivalent to those of brains And that is why strong AI has little In tell us about thinking. since it is not about machines but about programs, and no program by itself is sufficient for thinking.},

Analogs to developmental psychopathology, in which regulatory mechanisms for consciousness fail progressively and subtly understress, and to inattentional blindness, where a narrow 'syntactic band pass' de?ned by the rate distortion manifold of conscious attention results in pathological ?xation, seem inevitable. Similar problems are likely to confront other possible architectures, although their mathematical description may be far less straightforward. Computing devices constructed on biological paradigms will inevitably lack the elaborate, but poorly understood, system of control mechanisms which has evolved over the last few hundred million years to stabilize consciousness in higher animals. This will make such machines prone to insidious degradation, and, ultimately, catastrophic failure.},

This is based on the\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$nfact that the notion of algorithm just requires an algorithm to\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$ncontain a finite but arbitrary number of rules. It is argued that\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$nintuitively people tend to think of an algorithm to have a rather\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$nlimited number of rules.

  abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein-protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-\$\textbackslash{}alpha\$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \textbackslash{}AAfor the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  title = {Mind: {{A Brief Introduction}}},
  isbn = {0-19-515733-8},
  abstract = {"The philosophy of mind is unique among contemporary philosophical subjects," writes John Searle, "in that all of the most famous and influential theories are false." In Mind, Searle dismantles these famous and influential theories as he presents a vividly written, comprehensive introduction to the mind. Here readers will find one of the world's most eminent thinkers shedding light on the central concern of modern philosophy. Searle begins with a look at the twelve problems of philosophy of mind-which he calls "Descartes and Other Disasters"-problems which he returns to throughout the volume, as he illuminates such topics as the freedom of the will, the actual operation of mental causation, the nature and functioning of the unconscious, the analysis of perception, and the concept of the self. One of the key chapters is on the mind-body problem, which Searle analyzes brilliantly. He argues that all forms of consciousness-from feeling thirsty to wondering how to translate Mallarme-are caused by the behavior of neurons and are realized in the brain system, which is itself composed of neurons. But this does not mean that consciousness is nothing but neuronal behavior. The main point of having the concept of consciousness, Searle points out, is to capture the first person subjective features of the phenomenon and this point is lost if we redefine consciousness in third person objective terms. Described as a "dragonslayer by temperament," John Searle offers here a refreshingly direct and open discussion of philosophy, one that skewers accepted wisdom even as it offers striking new insights into the nature of consciousness and the mind.},

One day its designers arranged for it to learn that its spare battery, its precious energy supply, was locked in a room with a time bomb set to go off soon. R1 located the room, and the key to the door, and formulated a plan to rescue its battery. There was a wagon in the room, and the battery was on the wagon, and R1 hypothesized that a certain action which it called PULLOUT (Wagon, Room, t) would result in the battery being removed from the room. Straightaway it acted, and did succeed in getting the battery out of the room before the bomb went off. Unfortunately, however, the bomb was also on the wagon. R1 knew that the bomb was on the wagon in the room, but didn't realize that pulling the wagon would bring the bomb out along with the battery. Poor R1 had missed that obvious implication of its planned act.},

  abstract = {A number of leading cognitive architectures that are inspired by the human brain, at various levels of granularity, are reviewed and compared, with special attention paid to the way their internal structures and dynamics map onto neural processes. Four categories of Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures (BICAs) are considered, with multiple examples of each category briefly reviewed, and selected examples discussed in more depth: primarily symbolic architectures (e.g. ACT-R), emergentist architectures (e.g. DeSTIN), developmental robotics architectures (e.g. IM-CLEVER), and our central focus, hybrid architectures (e.g. LIDA, CLARION, 4D/RCS, DUAL, MicroPsi, and OpenCog). Given the state of the art in BICA, it is not yet possible to tell whether emulating the brain on the architectural level is going to be enough to allow rough emulation of brain function; and given the state of the art in neuroscience, it is not yet possible to connect BICAs with large-scale brain simulations in a thoroughgoing way. However, it is nonetheless possible to draw reasonably close function connections between various components of various BICAs and various brain regions and dynamics, and as both BICAs and brain simulations mature, these connections should become richer and may extend further into the domain of internal dynamics as well as overall behavior. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Those making the distinction claim that the intentionality of our artifacts is `parasitic' on the `genu- ine' intentionality to be found in members of the former class of things. In Kinds of Minds: Toward an Understanding of Consciousness, Daniel Dennett criticizes that claim and the distinction it rests on, and seeks to show that ``metaphysically original intentionality'' is illusory by working out the implications he sees in the practical possibility of a certain type of robot, i.e., one that generates `ut- terances' which are `inscrutable to the robot's designers' so that we, and they, must consult the robot to discover the meaning of its utterances. I argue that the implications Dennett finds are erroneous, regardless of whether such a robot is possible, and therefore that the real existence ofmetaphysically original intentionality has not been undermined by the possibility of the robot Dennett describes.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE A prospective randomized trial was conducted to determine whether the addition of concurrent cisplatin to preoperative or definitive radiation therapy in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer improved local control or survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS Ninety-nine eligible patients with T2 to T4b transitional cell bladder cancer participated, 64\% with cT3b or cT4. Patients and their physicians selected either definitive radiotherapy or precystectomy radiotherapy; patients were then randomly allocated to receive intravenous cisplatin 100 mg/m2 at 2-week intervals for three cycles concurrent with pelvic radiation, or to receive radiation without chemotherapy. Patients were stratified by clinical tumor stage and by radiation plan. The median follow-up duration is 6.5 years. RESULTS The occurrence of distant metastases was the same in both study arms. However, 25 of 48 control patients have had a first recurrence in the pelvis, compared with 15 of 51 cisplatin-treated patients (P = .036). The pelvic relapse rate in the two groups was significantly reduced by concurrent cisplatin (P = .038, log-rank test) and this effect was preserved in a stepwise Cox regression model of prognostic factors (hazards ratio, 0.50; 90\% confidence interval [CI], 0.29 to 0.86; P = .036). The hazard reduction was similar for both radiation plans. Pretreatment leukocytosis and high clinical stage were independent adverse factors in a Cox model of overall survival, but the effect of cisplatin was not significant. CONCLUSION Concurrent cisplatin may improve pelvic control of locally advanced bladder cancer with preoperative or definitive radiation, but has not been shown to improve overall survival. The use of concurrent cisplatin had no detectable effect on distant metastases.},

  abstract = {Replication or even modelling of consciousness in machines requires some clarifications and refinements of our concept of consciousness. Design of, construction of, and interaction with artificial systems can itself assist in this conceptual development. We start with the tentative hypothesis that although the word 'consciousness' has no well-defined meaning, it is used to refer to aspects of human and animal information processing. We then argue that we can enhance our understanding of what these aspects might be by designing and building virtual- machine architectures capturing various features of consciousness. This activity may in turn nurture the development of our concepts of consciousness, showing how an analysis based on information processing virtual machines answers old philosophical puzzles as well enriching empirical theories. This process of developing and testing ideas by developing and testing designs leads to gradual refinement of many of our pre-theoretical concepts of mind, showing how they can be construed as implicitly 'architecture-based' concepts. Understanding how human-like robots with appropriate architectures are likely to feel puzzled about qualia may help us resolve those puzzles. The concept of 'qualia' turns out to be an 'architecture-based' concept, while individual qualia concepts are 'architecture-driven'.},

Rychlak makes a particularly peculiar error in his insistence that computers are restricted to what he calls Boolean logic, which he characterizes by the use of exclusive disjunction. Although the exact form of the logic of the computer's hardware is of no deep significance, it is, in any case, usually characterized by inclusive rather than exclusive disjunction. Digital computers are built from electronic circuits whose parts can be in one of two states, typically encoded as voltages. These are often called bits. The computer's circuits can perform many operations on patterns of bits, fundamental among them being Boolean disjunction, so called because, if one regards the bits as truth-values, this operation would encode the logical connective or.},

R1 located the room, and the key to the door, and formulated a plan to rescue its battery. There was a wagon in the room, and the battery was on the wagon, and R1 hypothesized that a certain action which it called PULLOUT (Wagon, Room, t) would result in the battery being removed from the room. Straightaway it acted, and did succeed in getting the battery out of the room before the bomb went off. Unfortunately, however, the bomb was also on the wagon. R1 knew that the bomb was on the wagon in the room, but didn't realize that pulling the wagon would bring the bomb out along with the battery. Poor R1 had missed that obvious implication of its planned act.},

  volume = {79},
  issn = {00100277},
  abstract = {This introductory chapter attempts to clarify the philosophical, empirical, and theoretical bases on which a cognitive neuroscience approach to consciousness can be founded. We isolate three major empirical observations that any theory of consciousness should incorporate, namely (1) a considerable amount of processing is possible without consciousness, (2) attention is a prerequisite of consciousness, and (3) consciousness is required for some specific cognitive tasks, including those that require durable information maintenance, novel combinations of operations, or the spontaneous generation of intentional behavior. We then propose a theoretical framework that synthesizes those facts: the hypothesis of a global neuronal workspace. This framework postulates that, at any given time, many modular cerebral networks are active in parallel and process information in an unconscious manner. An information becomes conscious, however, if the neural population that represents it is mobilized by top-down attentional amplification into a brain-scale state of coherent activity that involves many neurons distributed throughout the brain. The long-distance connectivity of these 'workspace neurons' can, when they are active for a minimal duration, make the information available to a variety of processes including perceptual categorization, long-term memorization, evaluation, and intentional action. We postulate that this global availability of information through the workspace is what we subjectively experience as a conscious state. A complete theory of consciousness should explain why some cognitive and cerebral representations can be permanently or temporarily inaccessible to consciousness, what is the range of possible conscious contents, how they map onto specific cerebral circuits, and whether a generic neuronal mechanism underlies all of them. We confront the workspace model with those issues and identify novel experimental predictions. Neurophysiological, anatomical, and brain-imaging data strongly argue for a major role of prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and the areas that connect to them, in creating the postulated brain-scale workspace.

The particle flux at 2000 m depth is highly seasonal with only one main peak in February and March and is characterized by strong interannual variability. The comparison of the particle flux time series with the measurements of chlorophyll and phaeopigments in the sediment trap material, and chlorophyll-a concentrations at surface from SeaWiFS together with the similarity of the pattern observed in the alkenone flux, particulate organic carbon (POC) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) leads to the conclusion that the particle flux at this position is fast and directly coupled to the phytoplankton development and decay in the overlying euphotic zone. SeaWiFS chlorophyll-a data (1997-2001) and characteristics of the upper water column (mixed layer depth, depth of nitracline, primary production) as predicted by an eddy-permitting model of the North Atlantic coupled with a simple nitrate-phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus (NPZD) pelagic-ecosystem model are used to understand the observed interannual differences in particle flux at 2000 m. Our results suggest that the interannual differences in the observed particle flux are a direct consequence of the variability of phytoplankton biomass and primary production in the euphotic zone in this region. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Some support a correlation of conscious perception with early occipital events, others with late parieto-frontal activity. Here we attempt to make sense of these dissenting results. On the basis of the global neuronal workspace hypothesis, we propose a taxonomy that distinguishes between vigilance and access to conscious report, as well as between subliminal, preconscious and conscious processing. We suggest that these distinctions map onto different neural mechanisms, and that conscious perception is systematically associated with surges of parieto-frontal activity causing top-down amplification.},

To achieve this, we employ single-end controlled available bandwidth estimation tools and a colluding network entity that can modulate the traffic destined for the victim. To expose the circuit including the source, we inject a number of short or one large burst of traffic. Although timing attacks have been successful against anonymity networks, they require either a Global Adversary or the compromise of substantial number of anonymity nodes. Our technique does not require compromise of, or collaboration with, any such entity. To validate our attack, we performed a series of experiments using different network conditions and locations for the adversaries on both controlled and real-world Tor circuits. Our results demonstrate that our attack is successful in controlled environments. In real-world scenarios, even an under-provisioned adversary with only a few network vantage points can, under certain conditions, successfully identify the IP address of both Tor users and Hidden Servers. However, Tor's inherent circuit scheduling results in limited quality of service for its users. This at times leads to increased false negatives and it can degrade the performance of our circuit detection. We believe that as high speed anonymity networks become readily available, a well-provisioned adversary, with a partial or inferred network map , will be able to partially or fully expose anonymous users.},

Much of this controversy arises from the use of the logic of dissociation.

Here we ask whether evidence acquired via the logic of opposition requires a dual-process account or whether it can be accommodated within a single similarity-based account. We report simulations using a simple neural network model of two artificial grammar learning experiments reported by Higham, Vokey, and Pritchard (2000) that dissociated conscious and unconscious influences on classification.

Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 34, 199-249], four studies suggested that the conscious, reflective processing system is vital for logical reasoning. Substantial decrements in logical reasoning were found when a cognitive load manipulation preoccupied conscious processing, while hampering the nonconscious system with consciously suppressed thoughts failed to impair reasoning (Experiment 1). Nonconscious activation (priming) of the idea of logical reasoning increased the activation of logic-relevant concepts, but failed to improve logical reasoning performance (Experiments 2a-2c) unless the logical conclusions were largely intuitive and thus not reliant on logical reasoning (Experiment 3). Meanwhile, stimulating the conscious goal of reasoning well led to improvements in reasoning performance (Experiment 4).

In his book, Consciousness and Robot Sentience, Haikonen seems to claim back the predominant position that engineering should have in a domain, where we are supposed to deliver pragmatic solutions. In this regard, Haikonen is actually bridging the gap between the philosophical discourse and the practical engineering approach. This is a remarkable movement as Haikonen is essentially claiming that his cognitive architecture is a proof of the inexistence of such a thing as a mind-body problem.

Intuitive definitions of consciousness generally involve perception, emotions, attention, self-recognition, theory of mind, volition, etc. Due to this compositional definition of the term consciousness it is usually difficult to define both what is exactly a conscious being and how consciousness could be implemented in artificial machines. When we look into the most evolved biological examples of conscious beings, like great apes or humans, the vast complexity of observed cognitive interactions in conjunction with the lack of comprehensive understanding of low level neural mechanisms makes the reverse engineering task virtually unreachable. With the aim to effectively address the problem of modeling consciousness at a cognitive level, in this work we propose a concrete developmental path in which key stages in the progressive process of building conscious machines are identified and characterized. Furthermore, a method for calculating a quantitative measure of artificial consciousness is presented. The application of the proposed framework is illustrated with the comparative study of different software agents designed to compete in a first-person shooter video game.},

  abstract = {It is often the case that related pieces of information lie in adjacent but different types of data sources. Besides extracting such information from each particular type of source, an important issue raised is how to put together all the pieces of information extracted by each source, or, more generally, what is the optimal way to collectively extract information, considering all media sources together. This chapter presents a machine learning method for extracting complex semantics stemming from multimedia sources. The method is based on transforming the inference problem into a graph expansion problem, expressing graph expansion operators as a combination of elementary ones and optimally seeking elementary graph operators. The latter issue is then reduced to learn a set of soft classifiers, based on features each one corresponding to a unique graph path. The advantages of the method are demonstrated on an athletics web pages corpus, comprising images and text.},

  abstract = {Sensible Quantum Mechanics or Mindless Sensationalism is a framework for relating consciousness to a quantum universe. It states that each conscious perception has a measure that is given by the expectation value of a corresponding quantum "awareness operator" in a fixed quantum state of the universe. The measures can be interpreted as frequency-type probabilities for a large set of perceptions that all actually exist with varying degrees of reality, so detailed theories within this framework are testable. The measures are not propensities for potentialities to be actualized, so there is nothing indeterministic in this framework, and no free will in the incompatibilistic sense. As conscious perceptions are determined by the awareness operators and the quantum state, they are epiphenomena. No fundamental relation is postulated between different perceptions (each being the entirety of a single conscious experience and thus not in direct contact with any other), so SQM or MS, a variant of Everett's "many-worlds" framework, is a "many-perceptions" framework but not a "many-minds" framework.},

In this paper, we discuss some widely-used deep learning architectures and their practical applications. An up-to-date overview is provided on four deep learning architectures, namely, autoencoder, convolutional neural network, deep belief network, and restricted Boltzmann machine. Different types of deep neural networks are surveyed and recent progresses are summarized. Applications of deep learning techniques on some selected areas (speech recognition, pattern recognition and computer vision) are highlighted. A list of future research topics are finally given with clear justifications.},

Many of these responses seem to marginalize phenomenal consciousness, by presupposing a 'thin' conception of phenomenality. This conception is, we will argue, largely shared by anti-computationalist critics of MC. On the thin conception, physiological or neural or functional or organizational features are secondary accompaniments to consciousness rather than primary components of consciousness itself. We outline an alternative, 'thick' conception of phenomenality. This shows some signposts in the direction of a more adequate approach to MC.},

It may be wildly over-ambitious to suppose that human artificers can repeat Nature's triumph, with variations in material, form, and design process, but this is not a deep objection. It is not as if a conscious machine contradicted any fundamental laws of nature, the way a perpetual motion machine does. Still, many skeptics believe-or in any event want to believe-that it will never be done.

In the model, recurrent neural interactions take place in distinct yet interacting access and phenomenal brain loops. The effectiveness of feedback signaling onto sensory cortical maps is emphasized for the neural correlates of phenomenal consciousness. Two forms of top-down attention, attention for perception and attention for access, play differential roles for phenomenal and access consciousness. The model is implemented in a neural network form, with the simulation of single and multiple visual object processing, and of the attentional blink. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Experiments in which the consequences of selective inputs on brain activity are controlled and traced with great precision could provide such information. However, such strategies have thus far had limited success. By contrast, recent whole-brain computational modelling approaches have enabled us to start assessing the effect of input perturbations on brain dynamics in silico.},

  abstract = {The eastern wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) is an economically important upland game bird that has been successfully reintroduced in Wisconsin, USA, and now occurs across the entire state. Although populations have become relatively stable across much of the state, recent concerns have been expressed regarding a plateau in total harvest and declines in local abundance across some areas. Current ecological and demographic parameters are needed to develop biologically justifiable and efficient management strategies. To address these concerns, we used demographic data collected during recent studies on wild turkey survival and productivity in 2 contrasting landscapes with differing proportions of forest and open cover.We then used the properties of deterministic matrix models to identify parameters predicted to have the greatest effect on the finite rate of population change (l) in both landscapes. Our analyses projected population decline for turkeys in predominately forested landscapes (l\textonequarter{}0.782) and population increases in more open landscapes (l\textonequarter{}1.112). Variance-scaled sensitivities suggested that l was most sensitive to variation in nest and poult survival for populations in both landscapes. A life-table response experiment further indicated that higher l in open landscapes was largely attributable to greater rates of yearling and adult female survival during the nesting and brood-rearing period. Simulated variations suggest manipulations in female harvest during the fall either-sex season had less impact on l than did alterations in components of fecundity. Our model results indicated that wild turkey population growth varies across landscapes in southwest and west-central Wisconsin. Management practices that address factors influencing components of fecundity likely have the greatest effect on l in both landscapes. Additionally, populations in forested landscapes may requiremore conservative harvests to enhance female survival if population stability or increase is to be realized.},

This position has been attacked from several angles, most effectively, in my opinion, by John Searle in his now famous Chinese Room thought experiment. I critique this Searlean perspective on the grounds that, while it is probably correct in its essentials, it does not go far enough. Quite simply, it runs afoul of the problem of emergentism. The proffered solution to this problem is that consciousness (or very rudimentary forms of it) needs to be viewed as an inherent property of organic form. While this recasting of the problem solves the emergentist dilemma it opens up a number of other issues. However, the new problems, unlike the old, appear in principle to be amenable to scientific analysis.},

However, unless its design is properly constrained, such an MoC gives rise to what we call the boundary problem: an MoC that labels a system as conscious will do so for some \textendash{} perhaps most \textendash{} of its subsystems, as well as for irrelevantly extended systems (e.g., the original system augmented with physical appendages that contribute nothing to the properties supposedly supporting consciousness), and for aggregates of individually conscious systems (e.g., groups of people). This problem suggests that the properties that are being measured are epiphenomenal to consciousness, or else it implies a bizarre proliferation of minds. We propose that a solution to the boundary problem can be found by identifying properties that are intrinsic or systemic: properties that clearly differentiate between systems whose existence is a matter of fact, as opposed to those whose existence is a matter of interpretation (in the eye of the beholder). We argue that if a putative MoC can be shown to be systemic, this ipso facto resolves any associated boundary issues. As test cases, we analyze two recent theories of consciousness in light of our definitions: the Integrated Information Theory and the Geometric Theory of consciousness.},

The under- lying model is based on the known circuitry of the mammalian nervous system, the neuronal groups of which are approximated as binary composite units. The simulated nervous system includes just two senses\textemdash{}hearing and touch\textemdash{}and it drives a set of muscles that serve vocalisation, feeding and bladder control. These functions were chosen because of their relevance to the earliest stages of human life, and the simulation has been given the name CyberChild. The sys- tem's pain receptors respond to a sufficiently low milk level in the stomach, if there is simultaneously a low level of blood sugar, and also to a full bladder and an unchanged diaper. It is believed that it may be possible to infer the presence of consciousness in the simulation through observations of CyberChild's behav- iour, and from the monitoring of its ability to ontogenetically acquire novel reflexes. The author has suggested that this ability is the crucial evolutionary advantage of possessing consciousness. The project is still in its very early stages, and although no suggestion of consciousness has yet emerged, there appears to be no fundamental reason why consciousness could not ultimately develop and be observed.},

  abstract = {Those of us who passed many (well- or ill-spent?) childhood hours reading tales of rockets and robots, androids and tele- paths, galactic civilizations and time machines, know all too well that robots-hypothetical machines that simulate human behavior, often with an at least roughly human appearance-can be friendly or fearsome, man's best friend or worst enemy. When friendly, robots can be inspiring or pathetic-they can overawe us with their superhuman powers (and with their greater than human virtue as well, at least in the writings of some authors), or they can amuse us with their stupidities and naivete. Robots have been "known" to fall in love, go mad (power- or otherwise), annoy with oversolicitousness. At least in the literature of science fiction, then, it is possible for a robot to be "conscious"; that means (since 'consciousness', like 'material object' and 'universal', is a philosopher's stand-in for more substantial words) to have feel- ings, thoughts, attitudes, and character traits. But is it really possible? If it is possible, what are the necessary and sufficient conditions? And why should we philosophers worry about this anyway? Aren't the mind-body problem, the problem of other minds, the problem of logical behaviorism, the problem: What did Wittgenstein really mean in the private-language argument? (and why should one care?), more than enough to keep the most indus- trious philosopher of mind busy without dragging in or inventing the Problem of the Minds of Machines?-These are my concerns in this paper.},

Ten desiderata are identified, dealing with value systems \& motives, embodiment, sensorimotor contingencies, perception, attention, prospective action, memory, learning, internal simulation, and constitutive autonomy. These desiderata are motivated by studies in developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and enactive cognitive science. All ten focus on the ultimate aspects of cognitive development - why a feature is necessary and what it enables - rather on than the proximate mechanisms by which it can be realized. As such, the desiderata are for the most part neutral regarding the paradigm of cognitive science - cognitivist or emergent - that is adopted when designing a cognitive architecture. Where some element of a desideratum is specific to a particular paradigm, this is noted.},

  abstract = {Conscious awareness refers to information processing in the brain that is accompanied by subjective, reportable experiences. Current models of conscious access propose that sufficiently strong sensory stimuli ignite a global network of regions allowing further processing. The immense number of possible experiences indicates that activity associated with conscious awareness must be highly differentiated. However, information must also be integrated to account for the unitary nature of consciousness. We present a computational model that identifies conscious access with self-sustained percolation in an anatomical network. We show that the amount of integrated information ({$\Phi$}) is maximal at the critical threshold. To the extent that self-sustained percolation relates to conscious access, the model supports a link between information integration and conscious access. We also identify a posterior ``hotspot'' of regions presenting high levels of information sharing. Finally, competitive activity spreading qualitatively describes the results of paradigms such as backward masking and binocular rivalry.},

At the heart of this endeavor is the notion that brain connectivity can be abstracted to a graph of nodes, representing neural elements (e.g., neurons, brain regions), linked by edges, representing some measure of structural, functional or causal interaction between nodes. Such a representation brings connectomic data into the realm of graph theory, affording a rich repertoire of mathematical tools and concepts that can be used to characterize diverse anatomical and dynamical properties of brain networks. Although this approach has tremendous potential - and has seen rapid uptake in the neuroimaging community - it also has a number of pitfalls and unresolved challenges which can, if not approached with due caution, undermine the explanatory potential of the endeavor.

In recent years, research has been driven by possible uses in medi- cal/rehabilitation and military applications. Yet there are still significant barriers to the effective use and exploitation of this technology. Among the most pertinent of these factors is the power and actuation system and its impact of control, strength, speed and, perhaps most critically, safety. This work describes the design, construction and test- ing of an ultra low-mass, full-body exoskeleton system having seven degrees of freedom (DOFs) for the upper limbs and five degrees of freedom (DOFs) for each of the lower limbs. This low mass is primarily due to the use of a new range of pneumatic muscle actuators as the power source for the system. The work presented will show how the system takes advantage of the inherent controllable compliance to produce a unit that is powerful, providing a wide range of functionality (motion and forces over an extended range) in a manner that has high safety integrity for the user. The general layout of both the upper and the lower body exoskeleton is presented together with results from preliminary experiments to demonstrate the potential of the device in limb retraining, rehabilitation},

Newell and co-workers were the first to show the utility of a GW or "blackboard" architecture in a distributed set of knowledge sources, which could cooperatively solve problems that no single constituent could solve alone. The empirical connection with conscious cognition was made by Baars (1988, 2002). GW theory generates explicit predictions for conscious aspects of perception, emotion, motivation, learning, working memory, voluntary control, and self systems in the brain. It has similarities to biological theories such as Neural Darwinism and dynamical theories of brain functioning. Functional brain imaging now shows that conscious cognition is distinctively associated with wide spread of cortical activity, notably toward frontoparietal and medial temporal regions. Unconscious comparison conditions tend to activate only local regions, such as visual projection areas. Frontoparietal hypometabolism is also implicated in unconscious states, including deep sleep, coma, vegetative states, epileptic loss of consciousness, and general anesthesia. These findings are consistent with the GW hypothesis, which is now favored by a number of scientists and philosophers. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

To show the feasibility of this approach, Serratia marcescens bacteria are attached to microscale objects such as 10 micron polystyrene beads by blotting them in a bacteria swarm plate. Randomly attached bacteria are shown to propel the beads at an average speed of approximately 15 {$\mu$}m/sec stochastically. Using chemical stimuli, bacteria flagellar propulsion is halted by introducing copper ions into the motility medium of the beads, while ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid is used to resume their motion. Thus, repeatable on/off motion control of the bacteria integrated mobile beads was shown. On-board chemical motion control, steering, wireless communication, sensing, and position detection are few of the future challenges for this work. Small or large numbers of these microrobots can potentially enable hardware platforms for self-organization, swarm intelligence, distributed control, and reconfigurable systems in the future.},

  abstract = {The currently leading cognitive theory of consciousness, Global Workspace Theory (Baars 1988, 2003), postulates that the primary functions of consciousness include a global broadcast serving to recruit internal resources with which to deal with the current situation and to modulate several types of learning. In addition, conscious experiences present current conditions and problems to a ``self'' system, an executive interpreter that is identifiable with brain structures like the frontal lobes and precuneus (Baars, 1988). Be it human, animal or artificial, an autonomous agent (Franklin and Graesser 1997) is said to be functionally consciousness if its control structure (mind) implements Global Workspace Theory and the LIDA Cognitive Cycle, which includes unconscious memory and control functions needed to integrate the conscious component of the system. We would therefore consider humans, many animals (Seth, Baars, and Edelman 2005) and even some virtual or robotic agents (Franklin 2003, Shanahan 2006) to be functionally consciousness. Such entities may approach phenomenal consciousness, as found in human and other biological brains, as additional brain-like features are added. Here we argue that adding mechanisms to produce a stable, coherent perceptual field (Merker 2005) in a LIDA controlled mobile robot might provide a small but significant step toward phenomenal consciousness in machines (Franklin, 2005). We also propose that implementing several of the various notions of self in such a LIDA controlled robot may well prove another step toward phenomenal consciousness in machines.},

On another hand, consciousness is a very cultural concept, founding the main property of human beings, according to themselves. We propose to develop a computable transposition of the consciousness concepts into artificial brains, able to express emotions and consciousness facts. The production of such artificial brains allows the intentional and really adaptive behavior for the autonomous robots. Such a system managing the robot's behavior will be made of two parts: the first one computes and generates, in a constructivist manner, a representation for the robot moving in its environment, and using symbols and concepts. The other part achieves the representation of the previous one using morphologies in a dynamic geometrical way. The robot's body will be seen for itself as the morphologic apprehension of its material substrata. The model goes strictly by the notion of massive multi-agent's organizations with a morphologic control.},

Functions such as (i) storing and accessing past memories, (ii) dealing with immediate sensorimotor needs in the present, and (iii) projecting into the future for goal-directed behavior are good examples of how key brain processes are integrated into time. Moreover, it can even seem that the brain generates time (in the psychological sense, not in the physical sense) since, without the brain, a living organism cannot have the notion of past nor future. When combined with an evolutionary perspective, this seemingly straightforward idea that the brain enables the conceptualization of past and future can lead to deeper insights into the principles of brain function, including that of consciousness. In this paper, we systematically investigate, through simulated evolution of artificial neural networks, conditions for the emergence of past and future in simple neural architectures, and discuss the implications of our findings for conscious...},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

The aim of the project is not to make a conscious robot, but to make a robot that can interact with human beings in a robust and versatile manner in real time, take care of itself, and tell its designers things about itself that would otherwise be extremely difficult if not impossible to determine by examination. Many of the details of Cog's "neural" organization will parallel what is known (or presumed known) about their counterparts in the human brain, but the intended realism of Cog as a model is relatively coarse-grained, varying opportunistically as a function of what we think we know, what we think we can build, and what we think doesn't matter.

  title = {Representational {{Theories}} of {{Consciousness}}},
  abstract = {The idea of representation has been central in discussions of intentionality for many years. But only more recently has it begun playing a wider role in the philosophy of mind, particularly in theories of consciousness. Indeed, there are now multiple representational theories of consciousness, corresponding to different uses of the term ``conscious,'' each attempting to explain the corresponding phenomenon in terms of representation. More cautiously, each theory attempts to explain its target phenomenon in terms of intentionality, and assumes that intentionality is representation. An intentional state represents an object, real or unreal (say, I'll Have Another or Pegasus), and typically represents a whole state of affairs, one which may or may not actually obtain (say, that I'll Have Another becomes America's 12th Triple Crown winner in the Belmont Stakes in June, 2012). Like public, social cases of representation such as writing or mapmaking, intentional states such as beliefs have truth-value; they entail or imply other beliefs; they are (it seems) composed of concepts and depend for their truth on a match between their internal structures and the way the world is; and so it is natural to regard their aboutness as a matter of mental referring or designation. Sellars (1956, 1967) and Fodor (1975) argue that intentional states are states of a subject that have semantical properties, and the existent-or-nonexistent states of affairs that are their objects are just representational contents. So much is familiar and not very controversial. But problems of consciousness are generally felt to be less tractable than matters of intentionality. The aim of a representationalist theory of consciousness is to extend the treatment of intentionality to that of consciousness, showing that if intentionality is well understood in representational terms, then so can be the phenomena of consciousness in the relevant sense. The notions of consciousness most commonly addressed by philosophers are the following: (1) Conscious awareness of one's own mental states, and ``conscious states'' in the particular sense of: states whose subjects are aware of being in them. (2) Introspection and one's privileged access to the internal character of one's experience itself. (3) Being in a sensory state that has a distinctive qualitative or phenomenal property, such as the color one experiences in having a visual experience, or the timbre of a heard sound. (4) The matter of ``what it is like'' for the subject to be in a particular mental state, especially what it is like for that subject to experience a particular phenomenal property as in (3). Block (1995) and others have used ``phenomenal consciousness'' for sense (4), without distinguishing it from sense (3). (A further terminological complication is that some theorists, such as Dretske (1995) and Tye (1995), have used the expression ``what it is like'' to mean the qualitative property itself, rather than the present higher-order property of that property.) For each of the four foregoing notions of consciousness, some philosophers have claimed that that type of consciousness is entirely or largely explicable as a kind of representing. This article will deal mainly with representational theories of consciousness in senses (3) and (4). The leading representational approaches to (1) and (2) are ``higher-order representation'' theories, which divide into ``inner sense'' or ``higher-order perception'' views and ``higher-order thought'' accounts. For discussion of those, see the entry on higher-order theories of consciousness.},

Not only is the term employed to describe the global states of consciousness that are associated with post-comatose disorders, epileptic absence seizures, anaesthesia, and sleep, it plays an increasingly influential role in theoretical and methodological contexts. However, it is far from clear what precisely a level of consciousness is supposed to be. This paper argues that the levels-based framework for conceptualizing global states of consciousness is untenable and develops in its place a multidimensional account of global states. The notion of a conscious level plays an increasingly important role in the science of consciousness, but there has been little conceptual analysis of the notion and it is typically left unexplained.The standard conception of conscious levels identifies them with changes in a creature's degree of consciousness, but this conception is theoretically problematic and fails to do justice to the multifaceted nature of levels.Global states of consciousness are multidimensional phenomena that capture the cognitive and behavioural dimensions of consciousness, such as the ways in which conscious contents are gated and their functional roles.},

He argues that question (1) must be answered negatively because 'all' human mental activity is motivated by questions arising from consciousness and does not become knowledge until its results reach consciousness. The same principle requires that question (2) be answered in the negative because it is consciousness that "gives rise to" and motivates the continuation of mental activity. (edited)},

Many features of human consciousness will be wanted, some will not, and some abilities not possessed by humans have already been found feasible and useful in limited contexts. We give preliminary fragments of a logical language a robot can use to represent information about its own state of mind. A robot will often have to conclude that it cannot decide a question on the basis of the information in memory and therefore must seek information externally. G{\"o}del's idea of relative consistency is used to formalize non-knowledge. Programs with the kind of consciousness discussed in this article do not yet exist, although programs with some components of it exist. Thinking about consciousness with a view to designing it provides a new approach to some of the problems of consciousness studied by philosophers. One advantage is that it focusses on the aspects of consciousness important for intelligent behavior.},

We begin by acknowledging that we may be a little disadvantaged, in that consciousness studies do not form part of the engineering curriculum, and so we may be starting from a position of considerable ignorance as regards the study of consciousness itself. In practice, however, this may not set us back very far; almost a decade ago, Crick wrote: \&\#039;Everyone has a rough idea of what is meant by consciousness. It is better to avoid a precise definition of consciousness because of the dangers of premature definition. Until the problem is understood much better, any attempt at a formal definition is likely to be either misleading or overly restrictive, or both\&\#039; (Crick, 1994). This seems to be as true now as it was then, although the identification of different aspects of consciousness (P-consciousness, A-consciousness, self consciousness, and monitoring consciousness) by Block (1995) has certainly brought a degree of clarification. On the other hand, there is little doubt that consciousness does seem to be something to do with the operation of a sophisticated control system (the human brain), and we can claim more familiarity with control systems than can most philosophers, so perhaps we can make up some ground there.},

  abstract = {Understanding the neural bases of cognition has become a scientifically tractable problem, and neurally plausible models are proposed to establish a causal link between biological structure and cognitive function. To this end, levels of organization have to be defined within the functional architecture of neuronal systems. Transitions from any one of these interacting levels to the next are viewed in an evolutionary perspective. They are assumed to involve: (1) the production of multiple transient variations and (2) the selection of some of them by higher levels via the interaction with the outside world. The time-scale of these "evolutions" is expected to differ from one level to the other. In the course of development and in the adult this internal evolution is epigenetic and does not require alteration of the structure of the genome. A selective stabilization (and elimination) of synaptic connections by spontaneous and/or evoked activity in developing neuronal networks is postulated to contribute to the shaping of the adult connectivity within an envelope of genetically encoded forms. At a higher level, models of mental representations, as states of activity of defined populations of neurons, are discussed in terms of statistical physics, and their storage is viewed as a process of selection among variable and transient pre-representations. Theoretical models illustrate that cognitive functions such as short-term memory and handling of temporal sequences may be constrained by "microscopic" physical parameters. Finally, speculations are offered about plausible neuronal models and selectionist implementations of intentions. \textcopyright{} 1989.},

  abstract = {1 The ability to identify individual animals is a critical aid in wildlife and conservation studies requiring information on behaviour, distribution, habitat use, population and life-history parameters. We present a computer-aided photo-identification technique that relies on natural marks to identify individuals of Carcharias taurus, a shark species that is critically endangered off the eastern Australian coast and considered globally vulnerable. The technique could potentially be applied to a range of species of similar form and bearing natural marks. 2 The use of natural marks for photo-identification is a non-invasive technique for identifying individual animals. As photo-identification databases grow larger, and their implementation spans several years, the historically used visual-matching processes lose accuracy and speed. A computerized pattern-matching system that requires initial user interaction to select the key features aids researchers by considerably reducing the time needed for identification of individuals. 3 Our method uses a two-dimensional affine transformation to compare two individuals in a commonly defined reference space. The methodology was developed using a database of 221 individually identifiable sharks that were photographically marked and rephotographed over 9 years, demonstrating both the efficacy of the technique and that the natural pigment marks of C. taurus are a reliable means of tracking individuals over several years. 4 Synthesis and applications. The identification of individual animals that are naturally marked with spots or similar patterns is achieved with an interactive pattern-matching system that uses an affine transformation to compare selected points in a single-user computer-aided interface. Our technique has been used successfully on C. taurus and we believe the methodology can be applied to other species of a similar form that have natural marks or patterns. The identification of individuals allows accurate tracking of their movements and distribution, and contributes to better population estimates for improved wildlife management and conservation planning.},

About the same time, a logician, Yehoshua Bar-Hillel, pointed out that AI optimism was based on what he called the ``first step fallacy''. First step thinking has the idea of a successful last step built in. Limited early success, however, is not a valid basis for predicting the ultimate success of one's project. Climbing a hill should not give one any assurance that if he keeps going he will reach the sky. Perhaps one may have overlooked some serious problem lying ahead. There is, in fact, no reason to think that we are making progress towards AI or, indeed, that AI is even possible, in which case claiming incremental progress towards it would make no sense. In current excited waiting for the singularity, religion and technology converge. Hard headed materialists desperately yearn for a world where our bodies no longer have to grow old and die. They will be transformed into information, like Google digitizes old books, and we will achieve the promise of eternal life. As an existential philosopher, however, I suggest that we may have to overcome the desperate desire to digitalize our bodies so as to achieve immortality, and, instead, face up to and maybe even enjoy our embodied finitude.},

There has been great progress in the connectionist approach, and while it is still unclear whether the approach will succeed, it is also unclear exactly what the implications for cognitive science would be if it did succeed. In this paper I present a view of the connectionist approach that implies that the level of analysis at which uniform formal principles of cognition can be found is the subsymbolic level, intermediate between the neural and symbolic levels. Notions such as logical inference, sequential firing of production rules, spreading activation between conceptual units, mental categories, and frames or schemata turn out to provide approxi- mate descriptions of the coarse-grained behaviour of connectionist sys- tems. The implication is that symbol-level structures provide only approximate accounts of cognition, useful for description but not neces- sarily for constructing detailed formal models. In},

The unified brain-mind theoretical OA model explicitly captures (though in an informal way) the basic essence of brain functional architecture, which indeed constitutes a theory of consciousness. The OA describes the neurophysiological basis of the phenomenal level of brain organization. In this context the problem of producing man-made "machine" consciousness and "artificial" thought is a matter of duplicating all levels of the operational architectonics hierarchy (with its inherent rules and mechanisms) found in the brain electromagnetic field. We hope that the conceptual- theoretical framework described in this paper will stimulate the interest of mathematicians and/or computer scientists to abstract and formalize principles of hierarchy of brain operations which are the building blocks for phenomenal consciousness and thought. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We need to study what they do or can do, how they can do it, and how the natural ones can be emulated in synthetic minds. That requires: (a) understanding sets of requirements that are met by different sorts of minds, i.e. the niches that they occupy, (b) understanding the space of possible designs, and (c) understanding complex and varied relationships between requirements and designs. Attempts to model or explain any particular phenomenon, such as vision, emotion, learning, language use, or consciousness lead to muddle and confusion unless they are placed in that broader context. A methodology for making progress is summarised and a novel requirement proposed for a theory of how human minds work: the theory should support a single generic design for a learning, developing system that, in addition to meeting familiar requirements, should be capable of developing different and opposed philosophical viewpoints about consciousness, and the so-called hard problem. In other words, we need a common explanation for the mental machinations of mysterians, materialists, functionalists, identity theorists, and those who regard all such theories as attempting to answer incoherent questions. No designs proposed so far come close. \textcopyright{} 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

  abstract = {Haikonen envisions autonomous robots that perceive and understand the world directly, acting in it in a natural human-like way without the need of programs and numerical representation of information. By developing higher-level cognitive functions through the power of artificial associative neuron architectures, the author approaches the issues of machine consciousness. Robot Brains expertly outlines a complete system approach to cognitive machines, offering practical design guidelines for the creation of non-numeric autonomous creative machines. It details topics such as component parts and realization principles, so that different pieces may be implemented in hardware or software. Real-world examples for designers and researchers are provided, including circuit and systems examples that few books on this topic give. In novel technical and practical detail, this book also considers: the limitations and remedies of traditional neural associators in creating true machine cognition; basic circuit assemblies cognitive neural architectures; how motors can be interfaced with the associative neural system in order for fluent motion to be achieved without numeric computations; memorization, imagination, planning and reasoning in the machine; the concept of machine emotions for motivation and value systems; an approach towards the use and understanding of natural language in robots. The methods presented in this book have important implications for computer vision, signal processing, speech recognition and other information technology fields. Systematic and thoroughly logical, it will appeal to practising engineers involved in the development and design of robots and cognitive machines, also researchers in Artificial Intelligence. Postgraduate students in computational neuroscience and robotics, and neuromorphic engineers will find it an exciting source of information. \textcopyright{} 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Machines can be conscious, is the claim to be adopted here, upon examination of its different versions. We distinguish three kinds of consciousness: functional, phenomenal and hard consciousness (f-, p- and h-consciousness). Robots are functionally conscious already. There is also a clear project in AI on how to make computers phenomenally conscious, though criteria differ. Discussion about p-consciousness is clouded by the lack of clarity on its two versions: (1) First-person functional elements (here, p-consciousness), and (2) Non-functional (h-consciousness). I argue that: (1) There are sufficient reasons to adopt h-consciousness and move forward with discussion of its practical applications; this does not have anti-naturalistic implications. (2) A naturalistic account of h-consciousness should be expected, in principle; in neuroscience we are some way towards formulating such an account. (3) Detailed analysis of the notion of consciousness is needed to clearly distinguish p- and h-consciousness. This refers to the notion of subject that is not an object and complementarity of the subjective and objective perspectives.(4) If we can understand the exact mechanism that produces h-consciousness we should be able to engineer it. (5) H-consciousness is probably not a computational process (more like a liver-function). Machines can, in principle, be functionally, phenomenally and h-conscious; all those processes are naturalistic. This is the engineering thesis on machine consciousness formulated within non-reductive naturalism. \textcopyright{} 2009 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

We explored the reorganization of task architecture with practice by combining interference analysis (delays in dual-task experiment) and random-walk models of decision making (measuring the decision and non-decision contributions to RT). The main delay observed in the Psychologically Refractory Period at short stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA) values was largely unaffected by training. However, the range of SOAs over which this interference regime held diminished with learning. This was consistent with an overall shift observed in single-task performance from a highly variable decision time to a reliable (non-decision time) contribution to response time. Executive components involved in coordinating dual-task performance decreased (and became more stable) after extensive practice. The results suggest that extensive practice reduces the duration of central decision stages, but that the qualitative property of central seriality remains a structural invariant. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {What type of artificial systems will claim to be conscious and will claim to experience qualia? The ability to comment upon physical states of a brain-like dynamical system coupled with its environment seems to be sufficient to make claims. The flow of internal states in such systems, guided and limited by associative memory, is similar to the stream of consciousness. A specific architecture of an artificial system, termed articon, is introduced that by its very design has to claim being conscious. Non-verbal discrimination of the working memory states of the articon gives it the ability to experience different qualities of internal states. Analysis of the flow of inner states of such a system during typical behavioral process shows that qualia are inseparable from perception and action. The role of consciousness in learning of skills \textendash{} when conscious information processing is replaced by subconscious \textendash{} is elucidated. Arguments confirming that phenomenal experience is a result of cognitive processes are presented. Possible philosophical objections based on the Chinese room and other arguments are discussed, but they are insufficient to refute articon's claims that it is conscious. Conditions for genuine understanding that go beyond the Turing test are presented. Articons may fulfill such conditions and in principle the structure of their experiences may be arbitrarily close to human.

Words have\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$ndenotations and intensional meanings because the brain transforms\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$nthe physical stimuli received from the microworld into a qualitative,\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$nmacroscopic representation for consciousness. Lacking this capacity\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$nas programmed machines, computers have no representations for their\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$nsymbols to designate and mean. Unlike human beings in which consciousness\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$nand thought, with their inherent content, have emerged because of\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$ntheir organic natures, serial processing computers or parallel distributed\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$nprocessing systems, as programmed electrical machines, lack these\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$ncausal capacities.},

  abstract = {Visual awareness is a favorable form of consciousness to study neurobiologically. We propose that it takes two forms: a very fast form, linked to iconic memory, that may be difficult to study; and a somewhat slower one involving visual attention and short-term memory. In the slower form an attentional mechanism transiently binds together all those neurons whose activiry relates to the relevant features of a single visual object. We suggest this is done by generating coherent semi-syru:hronous oscillations, probably in the 40-70Hz range. These oscillations then activate a transient short-term (working) memory. We outline several lines of experimental work that might advance the understanding of the neural mechanisms involved. The neural basis of very short-term memory espedally needs more experimental study.},

  abstract = {"The philosophy of mind is unique among contemporary philosophical subjects," writes John Searle, "in that all of the most famous and influential theories are false." In Mind, Searle dismantles these famous and influential theories as he presents a vividly written, comprehensive introduction to the mind. Here readers will find one of the world's most eminent thinkers shedding light on the central concern of modern philosophy. Searle begins with a look at the twelve problems of philosophy of mind-which he calls "Descartes and Other Disasters"-problems which he returns to throughout the volume, as he illuminates such topics as the freedom of the will, the actual operation of mental causation, the nature and functioning of the unconscious, the analysis of perception, and the concept of the self. One of the key chapters is on the mind-body problem, which Searle analyzes brilliantly. He argues that all forms of consciousness-from feeling thirsty to wondering how to translate Mallarme-are caused by the behavior of neurons and are realized in the brain system, which is itself composed of neurons. But this does not mean that consciousness is nothing but neuronal behavior. The main point of having the concept of consciousness, Searle points out, is to capture the first person subjective features of the phenomenon and this point is lost if we redefine consciousness in third person objective terms. Described as a "dragonslayer by temperament," John Searle offers here a refreshingly direct and open discussion of philosophy, one that skewers accepted wisdom even as it offers striking new insights into the nature of consciousness and the mind.},

Pulling all of these strands together, Daniel Robinson then explains why this confrontation is so crucial to the understanding of neuroscientific research. Clearly argued and thoroughly engaging, the authors present fundamentally different conceptions of philosophical method, cognitive-neuroscientific explanation, and human nature, and their debate will appeal to anyone interested in the relation of mind to brain, of psychology to neuroscience, of causal to rational explanation, and of consciousness to self-consciousness.},

In this review, we aim to report the current state of the theoretical research and practical advances on this subject. We first give an overview of ELM from the theoretical perspective, including the interpolation theory, universal approximation capability, and generalization ability. Then we focus on the various improvements made to ELM which further improve its stability, sparsity and accuracy under general or specific conditions. Apart from classification and regression, ELM has recently been extended for clustering, feature selection, representational learning and many other learning tasks. These newly emerging algorithms greatly expand the applications of ELM. From implementation aspect, hardware implementation and parallel computation techniques have substantially sped up the training of ELM, making it feasible for big data processing and real-time reasoning. Due to its remarkable efficiency, simplicity, and impressive generalization performance, ELM have been applied in a variety of domains, such as biomedical engineering, computer vision, system identification, and control and robotics. In this review, we try to provide a comprehensive view of these advances in ELM together with its future perspectives.},

The author argues that what makes a state pain for a neuro-robot at a time is the functional role it has in the robot at the time, and this state is type identical to a specific circuit state. Support from an experimental study shows that if the neural network that controls a robot includes a specific `emotion circuit', physical damage to the robot will cause the disposition to avoid movement, thereby enhancing fitness, compared to robots without the circuit. Thus, pain for a robot at a time is type identical to a specific circuit state},

Cognitive functions such as anticipation and planning are realised through internal simulation of interaction with the environment. Action selection, in both actual and internally simulated interaction with the environment, is mediated by affect.

Here, I argue in favor of weak artificial consciousness, proposing that synthetic models of neural mechanisms potentially underlying consciousness can shed new light on how these mechanisms give rise to the phenomena they do. The approach I advocate involves using synthetic models to develop "explanatory correlates" that can causally account for deep, structural properties of conscious experience. In contrast, the project of strong artificial consciousness - while not impossible in principle - has yet to be credibly illustrated, and is in any case less likely to deliver advances in our understanding of the biological basis of consciousness. This is because of the inherent circularity involved in using models both as instantiations and as cognitive prostheses for exposing general principles, and because treating models as instantiations can indefinitely postpone comparisons with empirical data. \textcopyright{} 2009 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

We can now pin down the neurons that fire when a person reports becoming aware of a piece of information and understand the crucial role unconscious computations play in how we make decisions. The emerging theory enables a test of consciousness in animals, babies, and those with severe brain injuries.A joyous exploration of the mind and its thrilling complexities, Consciousness and the Brain will excite anyone interestedin cutting-edge science and technology and the vast philosophical, personal, and ethical implications of finally quantifyingconsciousness.From the Trade Paperback edition.},

Besides extracting such information from each particular type of source, an important issue raised is how to put together all the pieces of information extracted by each source, or, more generally, what is the optimal way to collectively extract information, considering all media sources together. This chapter presents a machine learning method for extracting complex semantics stemming from multimedia sources. The method is based on transforming the inference problem into a graph expansion problem, expressing graph expansion operators as a combination of elementary ones and optimally seeking elementary graph operators. The latter issue is then reduced to learn a set of soft classifiers, based on features each one corresponding to a unique graph path. The advantages of the method are demonstrated on an athletics web pages corpus, comprising images and text.},

The argument presented herein is a simple development of that originally presented in Putnam's (Representation \& Reality, Bradford Books, Cambridge in 1988) monograph, ``Representation \& Reality'', which if correct, has important implications for turing machine func- tionalism and the prospect of `conscious' machines. In the paper, instead of seeking to develop Putnam's claim that, ``everything implements every finite state auto- mata'', I will try to establish the weaker result that, ``everything implements the specific machine Q on a particular input set (x)''. Then, equating Q (x) to any putative AI program, I will show that conceding the `strong AI' thesis for Q (crediting it with mental states and consciousness) opens the door to a vicious form of panpsychism whereby all open systems, (e.g. grass, rocks etc.), must instantiate conscious experience and hence that disembodied minds lurk everywhere.},

  issn = {1793-8430},
  abstract = {The question about the potential for consciousness of arti\textasciimacron{}cial systems has often been addressed using thought experiments, which are often problematic in the philosophy of mind. A more promising approach is to use real experiments to gather data about the correlates of con- sciousness in humans, and develop this data into theories that make predictions about human and arti\textasciimacron{}cial consciousness. A key issue with an experimental approach is that consciousness can only be measured using behavior, which places fundamental limits on our ability to identify the correlates of consciousness. This paper formalizes these limits as a distinction between type I and type II potential correlates of consciousness (PCCs). Since it is not possible to decide empirically whether type I PCCs are necessary for consciousness, it is indeterminable whether a machine that lacks neurons or hemoglobin, for example, is potentially conscious. A number of responses have been put forward to this problem, including suspension of judgment, liberal and con- servative attribution of the potential for consciousness and a psychometric scale that models our judgment about the relationship between type I PCCs and consciousness.

  volume = {150},
  isbn = {0079-6123 (Print)\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$r0079-6123 (Linking)},
  abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are systems that allow us to translate in real-time the electrical activity of the brain in commands to control devices. They do not rely on muscular activity and can therefore provide communication and control for those who are severely paralyzed (locked-in) due to injury or disease. It has been shown that locked-in patients are able to achieve EEG-controlled cursor or limb movement and patients have successfully communicated by means of a BCI. Current BCIs differ in how the neural activity of the brain is recorded, how subjects (humans and animals) are trained to produce a specific EEG response, how the signals are translated into device commands, and which application is provided to the user. The present review focuses on approaches to BCIs that process the EEG on-line and provide EEG feedback or feedback of results to the user. We regard online processing and feedback cornerstones for routine application of BCIs in the field. Because training patients in their home environment is effortful and personal and financial resources are limited, only few studies on BCI long-term use for communication with paralyzed patients are available. The need for multidisciplinary research, comprising computer science, engineering, neuroscience, and psychology is now being acknowledged by the BCI community. A standard BCI platform, referred to as BCI2000, has been developed, which allows us to better combine and compare the different BCI approaches of different laboratories. As BCI laboratories now also join to unify their expertise and collaborations are funded, we consider it realistic that within few years we will be able to offer a BCI, which will be easy to operate for patients and caregivers.

These functional concepts keep a notable similarity to those underlying the notion of operating system in software engineering, which allows us to specialize the computer metaphor for the mind into that of the operating system metaphor for consciousness. In this article, departing from these ideas and a model-based theoretical framework for cognition, we present an architectural proposal for machine consciousness, called the Operative Mind. According to it, machine consciousness could be implemented as a set of services, in an operative system fashion, based on modeling of the own control architecture, that supervise the adequacy of the system architectural structure to the current objectives, triggering and managing adaptativity mechanisms.},

I argue that this poses serious problems for understanding the mind-brain relationship. To solve these problems, neural and behavioral measures should be put on an equal footing. I illustrate this by an example from visual neuroscience, in which both neural and behavioral arguments converge towards a coherent scientific definition of visual consciousness. However, to accept this definition, we need to let go of our intuitive or psychological notions of conscious experience and let the neuroscience arguments have their way. Only by moving our notion of mind towards that of brain can progress be made. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Current theories of artificial intelligence and the mind are dominated by the notion that thinking involves the manipulation of symbols. The symbols are in- tended to have a specific semantics in the sense that they represent concepts referring to objects in the external world and they conform to a syntax, being operated on by specific rules. I describe three alternative, non-symbolic approaches, each with a different em- phasis but all using the same underlying computational model. This is a network of interacting computing units, a unit representing a nerve cell to a greater or lesser degree of fidelity in the different approaches. Computational neuroscience emphasizes the development and functioning of the nervous system; the approach of neural networks examines new algorithms for specific applications in, for ex- ample, pattern recognition and classification; according to the sub-symbolic ap- proach, concepts are built up of entities called sub-symbols, which are the activ- ities of individual processing units in a neural network. A frequently debated question is whether theories formulated at the sub- symbolic level are 'mere implementations' of symbolic ones. I describe recent work due to Foster, who proposes that it is valid to view a system at many differ- ent levels of description and that, whereas any theory may have many different implementations, in general sub-symbolic theories may not be implementations of symbolic ones.},

  abstract = {The idea that human history is approaching a ``singularity''\textemdash{}that ordinary humans will someday be overtaken by artificially intelligent machines or cognitively enhanced biological intelligence, or both\textemdash{}has moved from the realm of science fiction to serious debate. Some singularity theorists predict that if the field of artificial intelligence (AI) continues to develop at its current dizzying rate, the singularity could come about in the middle of the present century. Murray Shanahan offers an introduction to the idea of the singularity and considers the ramifications of such a potentially seismic event. Shanahan's aim is not to make predictions but rather to investigate a range of scenarios. Whether we believe that singularity is near or far, likely or impossible, apocalypse or utopia, the very idea raises crucial philosophical and pragmatic questions, forcing us to think seriously about what we want as a species. Shanahan describes technological advances in AI, both biologically inspired and engineered from scratch. Once human-level AI\textemdash{}theoretically possible, but difficult to accomplish\textemdash{}has been achieved, he explains, the transition to superintelligent AI could be very rapid. Shanahan considers what the existence of superintelligent machines could mean for such matters as personhood, responsibility, rights, and identity. Some superhuman AI agents might be created to benefit humankind; some might go rogue. (Is Siri the template, or HAL?) The singularity presents both an existential threat to humanity and an existential opportunity for humanity to transcend its limitations. Shanahan makes it clear that we need to imagine both possibilities if we want to bring about the better outcome.},

  abstract = {Can we make progress exploring consciousness? Or is it forever beyond human reach? In science we never know the ultimate outcome of the journey.We can only take whatever steps our current knowledge affords. This paper explores todays evidence from the viewpoint of Global Workspace (GW) theory. First, we ask what kind of evidence has the most direct bearing on the question. The answer given here is contrastive analysis a set of paired comparisons between similar conscious and unconscious processes. This body of evidence is already quite large, and constrains any possible theory (Baars, 1983; 1988; 1997). Because it involves both conscious and unconscious events, it deals directly with our own subjective experience, as anyone can tell by trying the demonstrations in this article. One dramatic contrast is between the vast number of unconscious neural processes happening in any given moment, compared to the very narrow bottleneck of conscious capacity. The narrow limits of consciousness have a compensating advantage: consciousness seems to act as a gateway, creating access to essentially any part of the nervous system. Even single neurons can be controlled by way of conscious feedback. Conscious experience creates access to the mental lexicon, to autobiographical memory, and to voluntary control over automatic action routines. Daniel C. Dennett has suggested that consciousness may itself be viewed as that to which we have access. (Dennett, 1978) All these facts may be summed up by saying that consciousness creates global access. How can we understand the evidence? The best answer today is a global workspace architecture, first developed by cognitive modelling groups led by Alan Newell and Herbert A. Simon. This mental architecture can be described informally as a working theatre. Working theatres are not just Cartesian daydreamsthey do real things, just like real theatres (Dennett \{\&\} Kinsbourne, 1992; Newell, 1990). They have a marked resemblance to other current accounts (e.g. Damasio, 1989; Gazzaniga, 1993; Shallice, 1988; Velmans, 1996). In the working theatre, focal consciousness acts as a bright spot on the stage, directed there by the selective spotlight of attention. The bright spot is further surrounded by a fringe, of vital but vaguely conscious events (Mangan, 1993). The entire stage of the theatre corresponds to working memory, the immediate memory system in which we talk to ourselves, visualize places and people, and plan actions. Information from the bright spot is globally distributed through the theatre, to two classes of complex unconscious processors: those in the darkened theatre audience mainly receive information from the bright spot; while behind the scenes, unconscious contextual systems shape events in the bright spot. One example of such a context is the unconscious philosophical assumptions with which we tend to approach the topic of consciousness. Another is the right parietal map that creates a spatial context for visual scenes (Kinsbourne, 1993). Baars (1983;1988; 1997) has developed these arguments in great detail, and aspects of this framework have now been taken up by others, such as the philosopher David Chalmers (1996). Some brain implications of the theory have been explored. GlobalWorkspace (GW) theory provides the most useful framework to date for our rapidly accumulating body of evidence. It is consistent with our current knowledge, and can be enriched to include other aspects of human experience.},

The computational perspective provides an understanding of how a mechanism functions in broader environments that determines the computations it needs to perform (and may fail to perform). The representation and algorithmic perspective offers an understanding of how information about the environment is encoded within the mechanism and what are the patterns of organization that enable the parts of the mechanism to produce the phenomenon. The implementation perspective yields an understanding of the neural details of the mechanism and how they constrain function and algorithms. Once we adequately characterize the distinct role of each level of analysis, it is fairly straightforward to see how they relate.},

This contribution revisits Marr's (1982) three levels of analysis (implementation, algorithmic, and computational) and evaluates the prospect of making progress at each individual level. After reviewing limitations of theorizing within a level, two strategies for integration across levels are considered. One is top\textendash{}down in that it attempts to build a bridge from the computational to algorithmic level. Limitations of this approach include insufficient theoretical constraint at the computation level to provide a foundation for integration, and that people are suboptimal for reasons other than capacity limitations. Instead, an inside-out approach is forwarded in which all three levels of analysis are integrated via the algorithmic level. This approach maximally leverages mutual data constraints at all levels. For example, algorithmic models can be used to interpret brain imaging data, and brain imaging data can be used to select among competing models. Examples of this approach to integration are provided. This merging of levels raises questions about the relevance of Marr's tripartite view.},

It is part of a theory of mental content proposed by Dennett, which provides the underpinnings of his later works on free will, consciousness, folk psychology, and evolution.

Here is how it works: first you decide to treat the object whose behavior is to be predicted as a rational agent; then you figure out what beliefs that agent ought to have, given its place in the world and its purpose. Then you figure out what desires it ought to have, on the same considerations, and finally you predict that this rational agent will act to further its goals in the light of its beliefs. A little practical reasoning from the chosen set of beliefs and desires will in most instances yield a decision about what the agent ought to do; that is what you predict the agent will do.},

  title = {Mental {{Representation}}},
  abstract = {The notion of a ``mental representation'' is, arguably, in the firstinstance a theoretical construct of cognitive science. As such, it is abasic concept of the Computational Theory of Mind, according to whichcognitive states and processes are constituted by the occurrence,transformation and storage (in the mind/brain) of information-bearingstructures (representations) of one kind or another., However, on the assumption that a representation is an object withsemantic properties (content, reference, truth-conditions,truth-value, etc.), a mental representation may be more broadlyconstrued as a mental object with semantic properties. As such, mentalrepresentations (and the states and processes that involve them) neednot be understood only in computational terms. On this broaderconstrual, mental representation is a philosophical topic with rootsin antiquity and a rich history and literature predating the recent``cognitive revolution,'' and which continues to be of interest in purephilosophy. Though most contemporary philosophers of mind acknowledgethe relevance and importance of cognitive science, they vary in theirdegree of engagement with its literature, methods and results; andthere remain, for many, issues concerning the representationalproperties of the mind that can be addressed independently of thecomputational hypothesis., Though the term `Representational Theory of Mind' issometimes used almost interchangeably with `Computational Theoryof Mind', I will use it here to refer to any theory thatpostulates the existence of semantically evaluable mental objects,including philosophy's stock in trade mentalia \textemdash{} thoughts,concepts, percepts, ideas, impressions, notions, rules, schemas,images, phantasms, etc. \textemdash{} as well as the various sorts of``subpersonal'' representations postulated by cognitivescience. Representational theories may thus be contrasted withtheories, such as those of Baker (1995), Collins (1987), Dennett(1987), Gibson (1966, 1979), Reid (1764/1997), Stich (1983) and Thau(2002), which deny the existence of such things.},

  abstract = {Empirical research inevitably includes constructing a data set by processing raw data into a form ready for statistical analysis. Data processing often involves choices among several reasonable options for excluding, transforming, and coding data. We suggest that instead of performing only one analysis, researchers could perform a multiverse analysis, which involves performing all analyses across the whole set of alternatively processed data sets corresponding to a large set of reasonable scenarios. Using an example focusing on the effect of fertility on religiosity and political attitudes, we show that analyzing a single data set can be misleading and propose a multiverse analysis as an alternative practice. A multiverse analysis offers an idea of how much the conclusions change because of arbitrary choices in data construction and gives pointers as to which choices are most consequential in the fragility of the result.},

  abstract = {Corruption is a social plague: gains accrue to small groups, while its costs are borne by everyone. Significant variation in its level between and within countries suggests a relationship between social structure and the prevalence of corruption, yet, large-scale empirical studies thereof have been missing due to lack of data. In this paper, we relate the structural characteristics of social capital of settlements with corruption in their local governments. Using datasets from Hungary, we quantify corruption risk by suppressed competition and lack of transparency in the settlement's awarded public contracts. We characterize social capital using social network data from a popular online platform. Controlling for social, economic and political factors, we find that settlements with fragmented social networks, indicating an excess of bonding social capital has higher corruption risk, and settlements with more diverse external connectivity, suggesting a surplus of bridging social capital is less exposed to corruption. We interpret fragmentation as fostering in-group favouritism and conformity, which increase corruption, while diversity facilitates impartiality in public life and stifles corruption.},

It has been a major factor in the reductions in morbidity and mortality that have been achieved in some of the non-communicable diseases, notably cancer and cardiovascular disease. Over the past two decades, an international collaborative effort has been mounted to build the evidence and the capacity for early intervention in the psychotic disorders, notably schizophrenia, where for so long deep pessimism had reigned. The origins and rapid development of early intervention in psychosis are described from a personal and Australian perspective. This uniquely evidence-informed, evidence-building and cost-effective reform provides a blueprint and launch pad to radically change the wider landscape of mental health care and dissolve many of the barriers that have constrained progress for so long.},

As the onset often occurs in youth, there is a clear imperative for early identification and intervention to ameliorate, if not prevent, associated distress. \emph{Methods:} An extensive search of relevant databases and an ancestry search was undertaken. \emph{Results:} There is a limited but growing body of literature on this topic that is discussed in relation to a clinical staging model, which may prove to be a useful framework for identifying where an individual lies along the continuum of the course of a depressive illness thus allowing interventions to be matched for that stage. The identification of a subsyndromal and prodromal stage of depressive disorders provides early intervention opportunities. \emph{Conclusions:} It is argued that a clinical staging heuristic may increase the number of those treated early, which may in turn delay or prevent onset, reduce severity, or prevent progression in the course of depressive disorders.},

  abstract = {Objective: Affective psychoses and bipolar disorders have been neglected in the development of early intervention strategies. This paper aims to gather current knowledge on the early phase of bipolar disorders in order to define new targets for early intervention. Methods: Literature review based on the main computerized databases (MEDLINE, PUBMED and PSYCHLIT) and hand search of relevant literature. Results: Based on current knowledge, it is likely that an approach aiming at the identification of impending first-episode mania is the most realistic and manageable strategy to promote earlier treatment. During the period preceding the onset of the first manic episode, patients go through a prodromal phase marked by the presence of mood fluctuation, sleep disturbance, and other symptoms such as irritability, anger, or functional impairment. Additionally, various risk factors and markers of vulnerability to bipolar disorders have been identified. Conclusions: In the few months preceding first-episode mania, patients go through a prodrome phase (proximal prodrome) that could become an important target for early intervention. However, considering the low specificity of the symptoms observed during this phase, criteria defining high-risk profiles to first-episode mania should also include certain risk factors or markers of vulnerability. While more research is needed in high-risk groups (e.g., bipolar offspring), retrospective studies conducted in first-episode mania cohorts could provide valuable information about this critical phase of the illness.},

  abstract = {Recognition and timely action around ``warning signs'' of illness exacerbation is central to the self-management of bipolar disorder. Due to its heterogeneity and fluctuating course, passive and active mobile technologies have been increasingly evaluated as adjunctive or standalone tools to predict and prevent risk of worsening of course in bipolar disorder. As predictive analytics approaches to big data from mobile health (mHealth) applications and ancillary sensors advance, it is likely that early warning systems will increasingly become available to patients. Such systems could reduce the amount of time spent experiencing symptoms and diminish the immense disability experienced by people with bipolar disorder. However, in addition to the challenges in validating such systems, we argue that early warning systems may not be without harms. Probabilistic warnings may be delivered to individuals who may not be able to interpret the warning, have limited information about what behaviors to change, or are unprepared to or cannot feasibly act due to time or logistic constraints. We propose five essential elements for early warning systems and provide a conceptual framework for designing, incorporating stakeholder input, and validating early warning systems for bipolar disorder with a focus on pragmatic considerations.},

  abstract = {Psychiatric illnesses characterised by disorganized cognition, such as schizophrenia, have been described in terms of fragmentation and hence understood as reduction in functional brain connectivity, particularly in prefrontal and parietal areas. However, as graph-theory shows, relatively small numbers of nonlocal connections are sufficient to ensure global coherence in the modular small world network structure of the brain. We reconsider fragmentation in this perspective. Computational studies have shown that for a given level of connectivity in a model of coupled nonlinear oscillators, modular small-world networks evolve from an initially random organization. Here we demonstrate that with decreasing connectivity, the probability of evolving into a modular small-world network breaks down at a critical point, which scales to the percolation function of random networks with a universal exponent of {$\alpha$}=1.17. Thus, according to the model, local modularity systematically breaks down before there is loss of global coherence in network connectivity. We therefore propose that fragmentation may involve, at least in its initial stages, the inability of a dynamically evolving network to sustain a modular small-world structure. The result is in a shift in the balance in schizophrenia from local to global functional connectivity.},

  abstract = {Psychophysiological assessment is a core method used in psychopathology research that has led to important insights in relation to the etiology and maintenance of many disorders. However, laboratory psychophysiology has limited ecological validity. This limitation has resulted in the field moving toward ambulatory recordings of psychophysiology paired with ecological momentary assessment (EMA). This review uses the results of a comprehensive review of EMA psychophysiology studies to discuss applications, advantages, limitations, and future use of this methodology, including electrocardiography, blood pressure, electroencephalography, and more. Mobile psychophysiology has several advantages, including ecological validity, temporal precision, and concurrent evaluation of internally and externally generated contexts that influence physiological response. However, it is limited by the difficulty of conducting such studies and reduced experimental control. Future research using EMA psychophysiology should aim to record over longer periods, better integrate with everyday life, determine the utility of ecological momentary interventions based on psychophysiology, create guidelines for standardization, and aim to establish reliability and validity. EMA psychophysiology is a promising direction for the field and provides novel avenues for research and treatment of psychopathology, although methodological shortcomings must be addressed.

  abstract = {Complex networks emerging in natural and human-made systems tend to assume small-world structure. Is there a common mechanism underlying their self-organisation? Our computational simulations show that network diffusion (traffic flow or information transfer) steers network evolution towards emergence of complex network structures. The emergence is effectuated through adaptive rewiring: progressive adaptation of structure to use, creating short-cuts where network diffusion is intensive while annihilating underused connections. With adaptive rewiring as the engine of universal small-worldness, overall diffusion rate tunes the systems' adaptation, biasing local or global connectivity patterns. Whereas the former leads to modularity, the latter provides a preferential attachment regime. As the latter sets in, the resulting small-world structures undergo a critical shift from modular (decentralised) to centralised ones. At the transition point, network structure is hierarchical, balancing modularity and centrality - a characteristic feature found in, for instance, the human brain.},

Such structure emerges spontaneously in simple model neural networks, (e.g. coupled maps), through adaptive rewiring according to the dynamic functional connectivity. The utility of adaptive rewiring has so far exclusively been demonstrated for unweighted networks; it is anything but guaranteed to work as well for weighted networks. We investigate adaptive rewiring in weighted networks, comparing various right-skewed, symmetrical, and left-skewed fixed weight distributions. We examine how network clustering, path length, modularity, and rich club coefficients develop for weakly, intermediate and strongly coupled networks. At low coupling strength, the weight distribution, as well as episodes of functional synchrony, have a significant effect on network evolution. With increased coupling strengths, all weighted networks robustly develop architectures similar to the unweighted ones. Adaptive rewiring appears relatively ineffective in networks with (biologically implausibly) extreme right-skewed weight distributions but performed most economically in biologically plausible log-normal distributions.},

  abstract = {Sensing and perceiving involve enormous numbers of widely distributed dendritic and action potentials in cortex, before, during and after stimulus arrival but with differing spatiotemporal patterns.  Stimulus-activated receptors drive cortical neurons directly (olfactory) or indirectly through thalamocortical relays. The driven activity induces hemisphere-wide, self-organized patterns of neural activity called wave packets. Three levels of brain function are hypothesized to mediate transition from sensation and perception. Microscopic activity expressed by action potentials is sensory. Macroscopic activity of the whole forebrain expressed by behavior is perceptual. Mesoscopic activity bridges the gap by the formation of wave packets. They form when sensory input destabilizes the primary receiving areas by local state transitions. The sensory-driven action potentials condense into mesoscopic wave packets like molecules forming raindrops from vapor. The condensation disks sustain 2D spatial patterns of phase and amplitude of carrier waves in the beta and gamma EEG. The AM patterns correlate not with features but with the context and value of sensory stimuli for the subjects, in a word, their meaning. The wave packets from all sensory areas are broadly transmitted through the forebrain. They induce the formation of macroscopic patterns that coalesce like scintillating pools over much and perhaps all of each hemisphere. The prediction is made for clinical testing that wave packets are precursor to states of awareness. They are not by themselves accessible to experience, as may be the macroscopic states initiated by global state transitions.},

However, the integrative, multimodal nature of conscious experience appears to require a functional architecture that overcomes this modular segregation of function.

We describe a neuronal network model that aims at explaining how those physiological parameters may cohere with conscious reports. The model proposes that the step of conscious perception, referred to as access awareness, is related to the entry of processed visual stimuli into a global brain state that links distant areas including the prefrontal cortex through reciprocal connections, and thus makes perceptual information reportable by multiple means. We use the model to simulate a classical psychological paradigm: the attentional blink. In addition to reproducing the main objective and subjective features of this paradigm, the model predicts an unique property of nonlinear transition from nonconscious processing to subjective perception. This all-or-none dynamics of conscious perception was verified behaviorally in human subjects.},

It distinguishes two main computational spaces: a unique global workspace composed of distributed and heavily interconnected neurons with long-range axons, and a set of specialized and modular perceptual, motor, memory, evaluative, and attentional processors. Workspace neurons are mobilized in effortful tasks for which the specialized processors do not suffice. They selectively mobilize or suppress, through descending connections, the contribution of specific processor neurons. In the course of task performance, workspace neurons become spontaneously coactivated, forming discrete though variable spatio-temporal patterns subject to modulation by vigilance signals and to selection by reward signals. A computer simulation of the Stroop task shows workspace activation to increase during acquisition of a novel task, effortful execution, and after errors. We outline predictions for spatio-temporal activation patterns during brain imaging, particularly about the contribution of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate to the workspace.},

In particular, theorists must resist the temptation to see global accessibility as the cause of consciousness (as if consciousness were some other, further condition); rather, it is consciousness. A useful metaphor for keeping this elusive idea in focus is that consciousness is rather like fame in the brain. It is not a privileged medium of representation, or an added property some states have; it is the very mutual accessibility that gives some informational states the powers that come with a subject's consciousness of that information. Like fame, consciousness is not a momentary condition, or a purely dispositional state, but rather a matter of actual influence over time. Theorists who take on the task of accounting for the aftermath that is critical for consciousness often appear to be leaving out the Subject of consciousness, when in fact they are providing an analysis of the Subject, a necessary component in any serious theory of consciousness.},

Explications account for what it is for something to exist or occur or be a certain way. Both explanation and explication do important philosophical work. I show what it takes to defend genuine philosophical explanations. The sort of explanation I am interested in is incompatible not only with eliminating the target phenomenon, but also with reducing it to the explanans. I show how explication comes into play in determining whether some phenomenon can plausibly be given either a reductive or eliminative treatment. Explication helps us distinguish certain kinds of reductive and eliminative views, gives us a graded account of the philosophical cost of eliminations, and furnishes us with a certain limit upon what resources an eliminative view can plausibly claim. This last point exposes a defect in a family of eliminative views that seek to retain truths about what they eliminate. Before concluding, I offer a brief defense of common sense as a legitimate, though defeasible, source of philosophical evidence.},

Our models assume a synaptic depression mechanism leading to autonomous transitions between encoded memory patterns (latching dynamics), which account for the major characteristics of automatic semantic priming in humans. Using computer simulations, we demonstrated how findings that challenged attractor-based networks in the past, such as mediated and asymmetric priming, are a natural consequence of our present model's dynamics. Puzzling results regarding backward priming were also given a straightforward explanation. In addition, the current model addresses some of the differences between semantic and associative relatedness and explains how these differences interact with stimulus onset asynchrony in priming experiments.},

  abstract = {The neural principles behind semantic category representation are still under debate. Dominant theories mostly focus on distinguishing concrete from abstract concepts but in such theories divisions into categories for concrete concepts are more developed than for their abstract counterparts. An encompassing theory on semantic category representation could be within reach when charting the semantic attributes that are capable of describing both concept types. A good candidate are the three semantic dimensions defined by Osgood (potency, valence, activity). However, to show to what extent they affect semantic processing, specific neuroimaging tools are required. Electroencephalography (EEG) is on par with the temporal resolution of cognitive behaviour and source reconstruction, using high-density set-ups, is able to yield a spatial resolution in the scale of millimetres, sufficient to identify anatomical brain parcellations that could differentially contribute to semantic category representation. Cognitive neuroscientists traditionally focus on scalp domain analysis and turn to source reconstruction when an effect in scalp domain has been detected. Traditional methods will potentially miss out on fine-grained effects of semantic features possibly obscured by the mixing of source activity due to volume conduction. For this reason we have developed a mass-univariate analysis in the source domain using a mixed linear effect model. Our analyses reveal distinct networks of sources for different semantic features that are active during different stages of lexico-semantic processing of single words. With our method we identified differences in the spatio-temporal activation patterns of abstract and concrete words, high and low potency words, high and low valence words, and high and low activity words, and in this way shed light on how word categories are represented in the brain.},

However, what happens when the expectations are not high (mild to moderate semantic constraint) is not yet clear. By adopting a cross-factorial design, crossing sentence congruity with within-sentence word association, our EEG recordings show that association comes into play during semantic processing of the word only when the sentence is meaningless. We also performed an exploratory source localization analysis of our EEG recordings to chart the brain regions putatively implicated in processing the said factors and showed its complementarity to EEG temporal analysis. This study furthers our knowledge on sentence processing and the brain networks involved in it.},

What are the neural underpinnings of the conscious condition? This book approaches each of these questions from a scientific standpoint. But it contends that, before we can make progress on them, we have to give up the habit of thinking metaphysically, a habit that creates a fog of philosophical confusion. From this post-reflective point of view, the book argues for an intimate relationship between cognition, sensorimotor embodiment, and the integrative character of the conscious condition. Drawing on insights from psychology, neuroscience, and dynamical systems, it proposes an empirical theory of this three-way relationship whose principles, not being tied to the contingencies of biology or physics, are applicable to the whole space of possible minds in which humans and other animals are included.

The next three essays present Rosenthal's homomorphism theory of mental qualities and qualitative consciousness, and show how that theory fits with and helps sustain the HOT theory. A crucial feature of homomorphism theory is that it individuates and taxonomizes mental qualities independently of the way we're conscious of them, and indeed independently of our being conscious of them at all. So the theory accommodates the qualitative character not only of conscious sensations and perceptions, but also of those which fall outside our stream of consciousness. Rosenthal argues that, because this account of mental qualities makes no appeal to consciousness, it enables us to dispel such traditional quandaries as the alleged conceivability of undetectable quality inversion, and to disarm various apparent obstacles to explaining qualitative consciousness and understanding its nature. Six further essays build on the HOT theory to explain various important features of consciousness, among them the complex connections that hold in humans between consciousness and speech, the self-interpretative aspect of consciousness, and the compelling sense we have that consciousness is unified. Two of the essays, one an extended treatment of homomorphism theory, appear here for the first time. There is also a substantive introduction, which draws out the connections between the essays and highlights their implications.},

Whereas standard approaches to the neural correlates of consciousness have assumed a one-way causal-explanatory relationship between internal neural representational systems and the contents of consciousness, our approach allows for theories and hypotheses about the two-way or reciprocal relationship between embodied conscious states and local neuronal activity.},

I describe progress towards identifying `explanatory correlates' underlying four fundamental properties characterizing most if not all conscious experiences: (i) the co-existence of segregation and integration in conscious scenes, (ii) the emergence of a subjective first-person perspective, (iii) the presence of affective conscious contents, either transiently (emotion) or as a background (mood) and (iv) experiences of intention and agency that are characteristic of voluntary action. I also discuss how synthetic approaches can shed additional light on possible functions of consciousness, the role of embodiment in consciousness, and the plausibility of constructing a conscious artefact.},

  title = {The {{Turing Test}}},
  abstract = {The phrase ``The Turing Test'' is most properly used torefer to a proposal made by Turing (1950) as a way of dealing with thequestion whether machines can think. According to Turing, the questionwhether machines can think is itself ``too meaningless'' todeserve discussion (442). However, if we consider the moreprecise\textemdash{}and somehow related\textemdash{}question whether a digital computercan do well in a certain kind of game that Turing describes(``The Imitation Game''), then\textemdash{}at least in Turing'seyes\textemdash{}we do have a question that admits of precisediscussion. Moreover, as we shall see, Turing himself thought that itwould not be too long before we did have digital computers that could``do well'' in the Imitation Game., The phrase ``The Turing Test'' is sometimes used moregenerally to refer to some kinds of behavioural tests for the presenceof mind, or thought, or intelligence in putatively minded entities. So,for example, it is sometimes suggested that The Turing Test isprefigured in Descartes' Discourse on the Method. (Copeland(2000:527) finds an anticipation of the test in the 1668 writings ofthe Cartesian de Cordemoy. Gunderson (1964) provides an early instanceof those who find that Turing's work is foreshadowed in the work ofDescartes.) In the Discourse, Descartes says:, Although not everything about this passage is perfectly clear, itdoes seem that Descartes gives a negative answer to the questionwhether machines can think; and, moreover, it seems that his givingthis negative answer is tied to his confidence that no mere machinecould pass The Turing Test: no mere machine could talk and act in theway in which adult human beings do. Since Descartes explicitly saysthat there are ``two very certain means'' by which we canrule out that something is a machine\textemdash{}it is, according to Descartes,inconceivable that a mere machine could produce different arrangementsof words so as to give an appropriately meaningful answer to whateveris said in its presence; and it is for all practical purposesimpossible for a machine to have enough different organs to make it actin all the contingencies of life in the way in which our reason makesus act\textemdash{}it seems that he must agree with the further claim thatnothing that can produce different arrangements of words so as to givean appropriately meaningful answer to whatever is said in its presencecan be a machine. Given the further assumption\textemdash{}which one suspectsthat Descartes would have been prepared to grant\textemdash{}that only thingsthat think can produce different arrangements of words so as to give anappropriately meaningful answer to whatever is said in their presence,it seems to follow that Descartes would have agreed that the TuringTest would be a good test of his confident assumption that there cannotbe thinking machines. Given the knowledge that something is indeed amachine, evidence that that thing can produce different arrangements ofwords so as to give an appropriately meaningful answer to whatever issaid in its presence is evidence that there can be thinkingmachines., The phrase ``The Turing Test'' is also sometimes used torefer to certain kinds of purely behavioural allegedly logicallysufficient conditions for the presence of mind, or thought, orintelligence, in putatively minded entities. So, for example, NedBlock's ``Blockhead'' thought experiment is often said to bea (putative) knockdown objection to The Turing Test. (Block (1981)contains a direct discussion of The Turing Test in this context.) Here,what a proponent of this view has in mind is the idea that it islogically possible for an entity to pass the kinds of teststhat Descartes and (at least allegedly) Turing have in mind\textemdash{}to usewords (and, perhaps, to act) in just the kind of way that human beingsdo\textemdash{}and yet to be entirely lacking in intelligence, not possessed ofa mind, etc., The subsequent discussion takes up the preceding ideas in the orderin which they have been introduced. First, there is a discussion ofTuring's paper (1950), and of the arguments contained therein. Second,there is a discussion of current assessments of various proposals thathave been called ``The Turing Test'' (whether or not there ismuch merit in the application of this label to the proposals inquestion). Third, there is a brief discussion of some recent writingson The Turing Test, including some discussion of the question whetherThe Turing Test sets an appropriate goal for research into artificialintelligence. Finally, there is a very short discussion of Searle'sChinese Room argument, and, in particular, of the bearing of thisargument on The Turing Test.},

This thesis servedas a premise in the most influential argument against early theoriesthat identified mental states with brain states (psychoneural identitytheories). It also served in early arguments for functionalism.Nonreductive physicalists later adopted it (usually without alteration)to challenge all varieties of psychophysical reductionism. The argumenthas even been employed to challenge the functionalism it initiallymotivated., Reductionists have offered numerous responses. Initial responseseither attacked the argument from the multiple realizability premise tothe anti-reduction/identity theory conclusion or proposed revisions toclassical reductionism that accommodated the premise.

  abstract = {In this paper, we compare the mechanisms of protein synthesis and natural selection. We identify three core elements of mechanistic explanation: functional individuation, hierarchical nestedness or decomposition, and organization. These are now well understood elements of mechanistic explanation in fields such as protein synthesis, and widely accepted in the mechanisms literature. But Skipper and Millstein have argued (2005) that natural selection is neither decomposable nor organized. This would mean that much of the current mechanisms literature does not apply to the mechanism of natural selection. We take each element of mechanistic explanation in turn. Having appreciated the importance of functional individuation, we show how decomposition and organization should be better understood in these terms. We thereby show that mechanistic explanation by protein synthesis and natural selection are more closely analogous than they appear\textemdash{}both possess all three of these core elements of a mechanism widely recognized in the mechanisms literature.},

By using diffusion spectrum imaging, we noninvasively mapped these pathways within and across cortical hemispheres in individual human participants. An analysis of the resulting large-scale structural brain networks reveals a structural core within posterior medial and parietal cerebral cortex, as well as several distinct temporal and frontal modules. Brain regions within the structural core share high degree, strength, and betweenness centrality, and they constitute connector hubs that link all major structural modules. The structural core contains brain regions that form the posterior components of the human default network. Looking both within and outside of core regions, we observed a substantial correspondence between structural connectivity and resting-state functional connectivity measured in the same participants. The spatial and topological centrality of the core within cortex suggests an important role in functional integration.},

We measure global aspects of cortical graphs including the abundance of small structural motifs such as cycles, the degree of local clustering of connections and the average path length. We examine large-scale cortical connection matrices obtained from neuroanatomical data bases, as well as probabilistic connection matrices at the level of small cortical neuronal populations linked by intra-areal and interareal connections. All cortical connection matrices examined in this study exhibit ``small-world'' attributes, characterized by the presence of abundant clustering of connections combined with short average distances between neuronal elements. We discuss the significance of these universal organizational features of cortex in light of functional brain anatomy. Supplementary materials are at www.indiana.edu/{$\sim$}cortex/lab.htm.},

  abstract = {Many complex networks have a small-world topology characterized by dense local clustering or cliquishness of connections between neighboring nodes yet a short path length between any (distant) pair of nodes due to the existence of relatively few long-range connections. This is an attractive model for the organization of brain anatomical and functional networks because a small-world topology can support both segregated/specialized and distributed/integrated information processing. Moreover, small-world networks are economical, tending to minimize wiring costs while supporting high dynamical complexity. The authors introduce some of the key mathematical concepts in graph theory required for small-world analysis and review how these methods have been applied to quantification of cortical connectivity matrices derived from anatomical tract-tracing studies in the macaque monkey and the cat. The evolution of small-world networks is discussed in terms of a selection pressure to deliver cost-effective information-processing systems. The authors illustrate how these techniques and concepts are increasingly being applied to the analysis of human brain functional networks derived from electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography and fMRI experiments. Finally, the authors consider the relevance of small-world models for understanding the emergence of complex behaviors and the resilience of brain systems to pathological attack by disease or aberrant development. They conclude that small-world models provide a powerful and versatile approach to understanding the structure and function of human brain systems.},

  abstract = {Background
Loss of consciousness is an essential feature of general anesthesia. Although alterations of neural networks during anesthesia have been identified in the spatial domain, there has been relatively little study of temporal organization.

Methods
Ten normal male volunteers were anesthetized with an induction dose of propofol on two separate occasions. The duration of network connections in the brain was analyzed by multichannel electroencephalography and the minimum spanning tree method. Entropy of the connections was calculated based on Shannon entropy. The global temporal configuration of networks was investigated by constructing the cumulative distribution function of connection times in different frequency bands and different states of consciousness.

Results
General anesthesia was associated with a significant reduction in the number of network connections, as well as significant alterations of their duration. These changes were most prominent in the delta bandwidth and were also associated with a significant reduction in entropy of the connection matrix. Despite these and other changes, a global ``scale-free'' organization was consistently preserved across multiple subjects, multiple anesthetic exposures, multiple states of consciousness and multiple frequencies of the electroencephalogram.

Conclusions
Our data suggest a fundamental principle of temporal organization of network connectivity that is maintained during both consciousness and anesthesia, despite local changes. These findings are consistent with a process of adaptive reconfiguration during general anesthesia.},

Increasingly, science is concerned with the structure, behavior, and evolution of complex systems ranging from cells to ecosystems. In Networks of the Brain, Olaf Sporns describes how the integrative nature of brain function can be illuminated from a complex network perspective. Highlighting the many emerging points of contact between neuroscience and network science, the book serves to introduce network theory to neuroscientists and neuroscience to those working on theoretical network models. Sporns emphasizes how networks connect levels of organization in the brain and how they link structure to function, offering an informal and nonmathematical treatment of the subject. Networks of the Brain provides a synthesis of the sciences of complex networks and the brain that will be an essential foundation for future research.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks `rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them `small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

  abstract = {Ren{\'e} Descartes (1596\textendash{}1650) was a creative mathematicianof the first order, an important scientific thinker, and an originalmetaphysician. During the course of his life, he was a mathematicianfirst, a natural scientist or ``natural philosopher'' second, and ametaphysician third. In mathematics, he developed the techniques thatmade possible algebraic (or ``analytic'') geometry. In naturalphilosophy, he can be credited with several specific achievements:co-framer of the sine law of refraction, developer of an importantempirical account of the rainbow, and proposer of a naturalisticaccount of the formation of the earth and planets (a precursor to thenebular hypothesis). More importantly, he offered a new vision of thenatural world that continues to shape our thought today: a world ofmatter possessing a few fundamental properties and interactingaccording to a few universal laws. This natural world included animmaterial mind that, in human beings, was directly related to thebrain; in this way, Descartes formulated the modern version of themind\textendash{}body problem. In metaphysics, he provided arguments for theexistence of God, to show that the essence of matter is extension, andthat the essence of mind is thought. Descartes claimed early on topossess a special method, which was variously exhibited in mathematics,natural philosophy, and metaphysics, and which, in the latter part ofhis life, included, or was supplemented by, a method of doubt., Descartes presented his results in major works published during hislifetime: the Discourse on the Method (in French, 1637), withits essays, the Dioptrics, Meteorology, andGeometry; the Meditations on First Philosophy (i.e.,on metaphysics), with its Objections and Replies (in Latin,1641, 2nd edn. 1642); the Principles of Philosophy, covering his metaphysicsand much of his natural philosophy (in Latin, 1644); and thePassions of the Soul, on the emotions (in French, 1649).Important works published posthumously included his Letters(in Latin and French, 1657\textendash{}67); World, or Treatise onLight, containing the core of his natural philosophy (in French,1664); Treatise on Man (in French, 1664), containing hisphysiology and mechanistic psychology; and the Rules for theDirection of the Mind (in Latin, 1701), an early, unfinished workattempting to set out his method., Descartes was known among the learned in his day as a topmathematician, as the developer of a new and comprehensive physics ortheory of nature (including living things), and as the proposer of anew metaphysics. In the years following his death, his naturalphilosophy was widely taught and discussed. In the eighteenth centuryaspects of his science remained influential, especially hisphysiology, as did his project of investigating the knower inassessing the possibility and extent of human knowledge; he was alsoremembered for his failed metaphysics and his use of skepticalarguments for doubting. In the nineteenth century he was revered forhis mechanistic physiology and theory that animal bodies are machines(that is, are constituted by material mechanisms, governed by the lawsof matter alone). The twentieth century variously celebrated hisfamous ``cogito'' starting point, reviled the sense datathat some alleged to be the legacy of his skeptical starting point,and looked to him as a model of the culturally engaged philosopher. Hehas been seen, at various times, as a hero and as a villain; as abrilliant theorist who set new directions in thought, and as theharbinger of a cold, rationalistic, and calculative conception ofhuman beings. Those new to the study of Descartes should engage hisown works in some detail prior to developing a view of his legacy.},

  title = {Dualism},
  abstract = {This entry concerns dualism in the philosophy of mind. The term`dualism' has a variety of uses in the history ofthought. In general, the idea is that, for some particular domain,there are two fundamental kinds or categories of things orprinciples. In theology, for example a `dualist' issomeone who believes that Good and Evil\textemdash{}or God and the Devil\textemdash{}are independent and more or less equal forces in theworld. Dualism contrasts with monism, which is the theory that thereis only one fundamental kind, category of thing or principle; and,rather less commonly, with pluralism, which is the view that there aremany kinds or categories.  In the philosophy of mind, dualism is thetheory that the mental and the physical\textemdash{}or mind and body ormind and brain\textemdash{}are, in some sense, radically different kindsof thing. Because common sense tells us that there are physicalbodies, and because there is intellectual pressure towards producing aunified view of the world, one could say that materialist monism isthe `default option'. Discussion about dualism, therefore,tends to start from the assumption of the reality of the physicalworld, and then to consider arguments for why the mind cannot betreated as simply part of that world.},

@book{gonzalez_chinese_2007,
  title = {The {{Chinese Room}} Revisited : Artificial Intelligence and the Nature of Mind},
  abstract = {Charles Babbage began the quest to build an intelligent machine in the nineteenth century. Despite finishing neither the Difference nor the Analytical engine, he was aware that the use of mental language for describing the functioning of such machines was figurative. In order to reverse this cautious stance, Alan Turing postulated two decisive ideas that contributed to give birth to Artificial Intelligence: the Turing machine and the Turing test. Nevertheless, a philosophical problem arises from regarding intelligence simulation and make-believe as sufficient to establish that programmed computers are intelligent and have mental states, especially given the nature of mind and its characteristic first-person viewpoint. The origin of Artificial Intelligence is undoubtedly linked to the accounts that inspired John Searle to coin the term strong AI \rule{1em}{1pt}or the view that simply equates computers and minds. Especially emphasising the divergence between algorithmic processes and intentional mental states, the Chinese Room thought experiment shows that, since the mind is embodied and able to realise when linguistic understanding takes place, mental states require material implementation, a point that directly conflicts with the accounts that reduce the mind to the functioning of a programmed computer. The experience of linguistic understanding with its typical quale leads to other important philosophical issues. Searle's theory of intentionality holds that intentional mental states have conditions of satisfaction and appear in semantic networks; thus people know when they understand and what terms are about. In contrast, a number of philosophers maintain that consciousness is only an illusion and that it plays no substantial biological role. However, consciousness is a built-in feature of the system. Moreover, neurological evidence suggests that conscious mental states, qualia and emotions enhance survival chances and are an important part of the phenomenal side of mental life and its causal underpinnings. This renders an important gap between simulating a mind and replicating the properties that allow having mental states and consciousness. On this score, the Turing test and the evidence it offers clearly overestimate simulation and verisimilar make-believe, since such evidence is insufficient to establish that programmed computers have mental life. In summary, this dissertation criticises views which hold that programmed computers are minds and minds are nothing but computers. Despite the arguments in favour of such an equation, they all fail to properly reduce the mind and its first-person viewpoint. Accordingly, the burden of proof still lies with the advocates of strong AI and with those who are willing to deny fundamental parts of the mind to make room for machine intelligence.},

  abstract = {In philosophy, intentionality is the power of minds and mental statesto be about, to represent, or to stand for, things, properties andstates of affairs. To say of an individual's mental states that theyhave intentionality is to say that they are mental representations orthat they have contents. Furthermore, to the extent that a speakerutters words from some natural language or draws pictures or symbolsfrom a formal language for the purpose of conveying to others thecontents of her mental states, these artifacts used by a speaker toohave contents or intentionality. `Intentionality' is aphilosopher's word: ever since it was introduced into philosophyby Franz Brentano in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, ithas been used to refer to the puzzles of representation, all of whichlie at the interface between the philosophy of mind and the philosophyof language.

In each of these cases, Iam the subject of a mental state with a very distinctive subjectivecharacter. There is something it is like for me to undergoeach state, some phenomenology that it has. Philosophers often use theterm `qualia' (singular `quale') to refer tothe introspectively accessible, phenomenal aspects of our mentallives. In this broad sense of the term, it is difficult to deny thatthere are qualia. Disagreement typically centers on which mentalstates have qualia, whether qualia are intrinsic qualities of theirbearers, and how qualia relate to the physical world both inside andoutside the head. The status of qualia is hotly debated in philosophylargely because it is central to a proper understanding of the natureof consciousness. Qualia are at the very heart of the mind-bodyproblem. , The entry that follows is divided into ten sections. The firstdistinguishes various uses of the term `qualia'. Thesecond addresses the question of which mental states have qualia. Thethird section brings out some of the main arguments for the view thatqualia are irreducible and non-physical. The remaining sections focuson functionalism and qualia, the explanatory gap, qualia andintrospection, representational theories of qualia, qualia asintrinsic, nonrepresentational properties, relational theories ofqualia and finally the issue of qualia and simple minds.},

We analyse the meanings attached to these terms in cognitive science and robotics, proposing a set of conditions for situatedness and embodiment, and examine the claim that internal representational schemas are largely unnecessary for intelligent behaviour in animats. We maintain that current situated and embodied animats cannot be ascribed even minimal self-awareness, and offer a six point definition of embeddedness, constituting minimal conditions for the evolution of a sense of self. This leads to further analysis of the nature of embodiment and situatedness, and a consideration of whether virtual animats in virtual worlds could count as situated and embodied. We propose that self-aware agents must possess complex structures of self-directed goals; multi-modal sensory systems and a rich repertoire of interactions with their worlds. Finally, we argue that embedded agents will possess or evolve local co-ordinate systems, or points of view, relative to their current positions in space and time, and have a capacity to develop an egocentric space. None of these capabilities are possible without powerful internal representational capacities.},

  title = {Information},
  abstract = {Philosophy of Information deals with the philosophical analysis of thenotion of information both from a historical and a systematicperspective. With the emergence of the empiricist theory of knowledgein early modern philosophy, the development of various mathematicaltheories of information in the twentieth century and the rise ofinformation technology, the concept of ``information'' hasconquered a central place in the sciences and in society. Thisinterest also led to the emergence of a separate branch of philosophythat analyzes information in all its guises (Adriaans \& vanBenthem 2008a,b; Lenski 2010; Floridi 2002, 2011). Information hasbecome a central category in both the sciences and the humanities andthe reflection on information influences a broad range ofphilosophical disciplines varying from logic (Dretske 1981; vanBenthem \& van Rooij 2003; van Benthem 2006, see the entry on logic and information), epistemology (Simondon 1989) to ethics (Floridi 1999) and esthetics(Schmidhuber 1997a; Adriaans 2008) to ontology (Zuse 1969; Wheeler1990; Schmidhuber 1997b; Wolfram 2002; Hutter 2010). , There is no consensus about the exact nature of the field ofphilosophy of information. Several authors have proposed a more orless coherent philosophy of information as an attempt to rethinkphilosophy from a new perspective: e.g., quantum physics(Mugur-Sch{\"a}chter 2002),  logic (Brenner 2008), semantic information (Floridi 2011; Adams \&de Moraes 2016, see the entry on semantic conceptions of information), communication and message systems (Capurro \&Holgate 2011) and meta-philosophy (Wu 2010, 2016). Others (Adriaans\& van Benthem 2008a; Lenski 2010) see it more as a technicaldiscipline with deep roots in the history of philosophy andconsequences for various disciplines like methodology, epistemologyand ethics. Whatever one's interpretation of the nature ofphilosophy of information is, it seems to imply an ambitious researchprogram consisting of many sub-projects varying from thereinterpretation of the history of philosophy in the context of moderntheories of information, to an in depth analysis of the role ofinformation in science, the humanities and society as a whole. , The term ``information'' in colloquial speech is currentlypredominantly used as an abstract mass-noun used to denote any amountof data, code or text that is stored, sent, received or manipulated inany medium. The detailed history of both the term``information'' and the various concepts that come with itis complex and for the larger part still has to be written (Seiffert1968; Schnelle 1976; Capurro 1978, 2009; Capurro \& Hj{\o}rland2003). The exact meaning of the term ``information'' variesin different philosophical traditions and its colloquial use variesgeographically and over different pragmatic contexts. Although ananalysis of the notion of information has been a theme in Westernphilosophy from its early inception, the explicit analysis ofinformation as a philosophical concept is recent, and dates back tothe second half of the twentieth century. At this moment it is clearthat information is a pivotal concept in the sciences and humanitiesand in our every day life. Everything we know about the world is basedon information we received or gathered and every science in principledeals with information. There is a network of related concepts ofinformation, with roots in various disciplines like physics,mathematics, logic, biology, economy and epistemology. All thesenotions cluster around two central properties: , The elegance of this formula however does not shield us from theconceptual problems it harbors. In the twentieth century variousproposals for formalization of concepts of information were made: , Until recently the possibility of a unification of these theories wasgenerally doubted (Adriaans \& van Benthem 2008a), but after twodecades of research, perspectives for unification seem better. , The contours of a unified concept of information emerges along thefollowing lines: , The emergence of a coherent theory to measure informationquantitatively in the twentieth century is closely related to thedevelopment of the theory of computing. Central in this context arethe notions of Universality, Turingequivalence and Invariance: because theconcept of a Turing system defines the notion of a universalprogrammable computer, all universal models of computation seem tohave the same power. This implies that all possible measures ofinformation definable for universal models of computation (RecursiveFunctions, Turing Machine, Lambda Calculus etc.) are asymptoticallyinvariant. This gives a perspective on a unified theory ofinformation that might dominate the research program for the years tocome.},

  abstract = {The frame problem is about the things that stay the same and not the things that change. The two are not equivalent. The frame problem is more general than the situation calculus. It seems to appear in just about any temporal notation. When it does appear, it puts a severe strain on the inferential resources available in a deductive framework, even when deduction is extended non-monotonically. On the other hand, it is not obvious that the frame problem is a serious issue outside the context of logic. This chapter discusses inertia problem and ramification problem. The ramification problem is dealt with by selecting a model of the current situation and using it to make inferences. The inertia problem has always looked like an excellent opportunity to apply non-monotonic logic which, as everyone knows by now, is the name given to logical systems in which adding axioms can cause proofs to disappear. Most AI practitioners confront and solve the inertia problem without even noticing it. It would be different if theorem proving played a large role in problem solving, but it does not. The inertia problem is of interest mainly to a fringe group, those who believe that logical analyses are relevant to building knowledge representations. Logic is valuable as a tool for organizing the semantics of knowledge representations. If the inertia problem needs to be solved, then model theory may well prove indispensable to its solution.},

  abstract = {The subject of this article is the frame problem, as conceived by certain cognitive scientists and philosophers of mind, notably Fodor for whom it stands as a fundamental obstacle to progress in cognitive science. The challenge is to explain the capacity of so-called informationally unencapsulated cognitive processes to deal effectively with information from potentially any cognitive domain without the burden of having to explicitly sift the relevant from the irrelevant. The paper advocates a global workspace architecture, with its ability to manage massively parallel resources in the context of a serial thread of computation, as an answer to this challenge. Analogical reasoning is given particular attention, since it exemplifies informational unencapsulation in its most extreme form. Because global workspace theory also purports to account for the distinction between conscious and unconscious information processing, the paper advances the tentative conclusion that consciousness may go hand-in-hand with a solution to the frame problem in the biological brain.},

  title = {The {{Significance}} of the {{Body}} - {{Artificial Intellgeince}} and {{Embodied Cognition}}},
  abstract = {Artificial intelligence is a field with a diverse set of goals, and approaches to artificial intelligence. One approach to artificial intelligence takes the theoretical idea of embodiment, found predominately in phenomenology, into account in an attempt to, in the strongest sense of artificial intelligence, ``create persons''. Obviously, this approach faces a number of issues. This thesis delivers a critique of the lack of consideration of the specificity of the body found in robotics combined with artificial intelligence in the strong sense. Although this account takes the body into consideration, it fails to realize that the body plays a constitutive role in cognition. Moreover, the very aim of the project of `strong' artificial intelligence, namely to `create persons', is highly problematic. If persons are indeed created, it seems plausible to hold, and arguments are presented to the fact that these robotic persons would have to be granted inviolable rights and citizenship rights, on behalf of their personhood. As a consequence, this thesis proposes to abolish strong artificial intelligence in favour of what could be termed instrumental artificial intelligence. Instrumental artificial intelligence gives direct consideration to the specifics of embodiment and to its implications for cognition. By implementing instrumental artificial intelligence creating persons whom would have to be granted inviolable rights and even citizenship rights is avoidable. Instead, robotic agents with a high degree of artificial intelligence can be created without facing issues of reintroducing slavery by implementing instrumental artificial intelligence. Instrumental artificial intelligence provides a platform for addressing two traditionally distinct sides of artificial intelligence at the same time. On the one hand, it highlights the constitutive significance of embodiment for cognition. On the other hand, it draws out ethical and political considerations of embodied cognition. This also means, I argue, that the specificity of the body has much wider consequences than has been traditionally, and often is at present, assumed.},

  abstract = {What is consciousness? How do physical processes in the brain give rise to the self-aware mind and to feelings as profoundly varied as love or hate, aesthetic pleasure or spiritual yearning? These questions today are among the most hotly debated issues among scientists and philosophers, and we have seen in recent years superb volumes by such eminent figures as Francis Crick, Daniel C. Dennett, Gerald Edelman, and Roger Penrose, all firing volleys in what has come to be called the consciousness wars. Now, in The Conscious Mind, philosopher David J. Chalmers offers a cogent analysis of this heated debate as he unveils a major new theory of consciousness, one that rejects the prevailing reductionist trend of science, while offering provocative insights into the relationship between mind and brain. Writing in a rigorous, thought-provoking style, the author takes us on a far-reaching tour through the philosophical ramifications of consciousness. Chalmers convincingly reveals how contemporary cognitive science and neurobiology have failed to explain how and why mental events emerge from physiological occurrences in the brain. He proposes instead that conscious experience must be understood in an entirely new light--as an irreducible entity (similar to such physical properties as time, mass, and space) that exists at a fundamental level and cannot be understood as the sum of its parts. And after suggesting some intriguing possibilities about the structure and laws of conscious experience, he details how his unique reinterpretation of the mind could be the focus of a new science. Throughout the book, Chalmers provides fascinating thought experiments that trenchantly illustrate his ideas. For example, in exploring the notion that consciousness could be experienced by machines as well as humans, Chalmers asks us to imagine a thinking brain in which neurons are slowly replaced by silicon chips that precisely duplicate their functions--as the neurons are replaced, will consciousness gradually fade away? The book also features thoughtful discussions of how the author's theories might be practically applied to subjects as diverse as artificial intelligence and the interpretation of quantum mechanics. All of us have pondered the nature and meaning of consciousness. Engaging and penetrating, The Conscious Mind adds a fresh new perspective to the subject that is sure to spark debate about our understanding of the mind for years to come.},

Not everyone will agree on a single set of mechanisms that will explain the full range of human cognition, but such theories are within reach and we should strive to articulate them. In this book, Newell makes the case for unified theories by setting forth a candidate. After reviewing the foundational concepts of cognitive science--knowledge, representation, computation, symbols, architecture, intelligence, and search--Newell introduces Soar, an architecture for general cognition. A pioneer system in artificial intelligence, Soar is the first problem solver to create its own subgoals and learn continuously from its own experience. Newell shows how Soar's ability to operate within the real-time constraints of intelligent behavior, such as immediate-response and item-recognition tasks, illustrates important characteristics of the human cognitive structure. Throughout, Soar remains an exemplar: we know only enough to work toward a fully developed theory of cognition, but Soar's success so far establishes the viability of the enterprise. Given its integrative approach, Unified Theories of Cognition will be of tremendous interest to researchers in a variety of fields, including cognitive science, artificial intelligence, psychology, and computer science. This exploration of the nature of mind, one of the great problems of philosophy, should also transcend disciplines and attract a large scientific audience.},

For such networks attention is paid to the concept of dynamic groupoids, their symmetries and other properties. In the case of structural networks influenced by the orbit equivalence relations of a groupoid action, we describe how crosstalk, the emergence of subnetwork giant components and noise induced opportunities contribute to the structure of small world networks and Red Queen dynamics. We create some dynamic models and show how these systems can be formally encapsulated within the idea of a groupoid atlas. Further, we utilize specific geometrical methods to describe the formation of geodesics in the corresponding networks, and include the holonomy concept as providing a geometric representation associated with a phase transition.},

But conscious input activates more brain regions than are needed to identify coffee cups and faces.

Such functions can be viewed as properties of the subject, rather than the object, of experience \textendash{} the `observing self' that appears to be needed to maintain the conscious state.},

  abstract = {A global workspace is a hub of binding and propagation in a population of loosely coupled signaling elements. Global workspace (GW) architectures recruit many distributed, specialized agents to help resolve focal ambiguities. In the brain, conscious experiences may reflect a global workspace function. For animals the natural world is full of fitness-related ambiguities, suggesting a general adaptive pressure for brains to resolve focal ambiguities quickly and accurately. In humans and related species the cortico-thalamic (C-T) core is believed to underlie conscious aspects of perception, thinking, learning, feelings of knowing, emotions, imagery, working memory and executive control. The C-T core has many anatomical hubs, but conscious percepts are unitary and internally consistent at any given moment. The repertoire of conscious contents is a large, open set. These points suggest that a brain-based GW capacity cannot be localized in a single anatomical hub. Rather, it should be sought in a dynamic capacity for adaptive binding and propagation of neural signals over multi-hub networks. We refer to this as dynamic global workspace theory (dGW). In this view, conscious contents can arise in any region of the C-T core when multiple signal streams settle on a winner-take-all equilibrium. The resulting bound gestalt may ignite an any-to-many broadcast, lasting \textasciitilde{}100-200 ms, and trigger widespread adaptation in established networks. Binding and broadcasting may involve theta/gamma or alpha/gamma phase coupling. Conscious contents (qualia) may reflect their sources in cortex. Sensory percepts may bind and broadcast from posterior regions, while non-sensory feelings of knowing (FOKs) may be frontotemporal. The small focal capacity of conscious contents may be the biological price to pay for global access. We propose that in the intact brain the hippocampal/rhinal complex may support conscious event organization as well as episodic memory coding.},

Newell and co-workers were the first to show the utility of a GW or ``blackboard'' architecture in a distributed set of knowledge sources, which could cooperatively solve problems that no single constituent could solve alone. The empirical connection with conscious cognition was made by Baars (1988, 2002). GW theory generates explicit predictions for conscious aspects of perception, emotion, motivation, learning, working memory, voluntary control, and self systems in the brain. It has similarities to biological theories such as Neural Darwinism and dynamical theories of brain functioning. Functional brain imaging now shows that conscious cognition is distinctively associated with wide spread of cortical activity, notably toward frontoparietal and medial temporal regions. Unconscious comparison conditions tend to activate only local regions, such as visual projection areas. Frontoparietal hypometabolism is also implicated in unconscious states, including deep sleep, coma, vegetative states, epileptic loss of consciousness, and general anesthesia. These findings are consistent with the GW hypothesis, which is now favored by a number of scientists and philosophers.},

  abstract = {Previous studies document that cholinergic and noradrenergic drugs improve attention, memory and cognitive control in healthy subjects and patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. In humans neural mechanisms of cholinergic and noradrenergic modulation have mainly been analyzed by investigating drug-induced changes of task-related neural activity measured with fMRI. Endogenous neural activity has often been neglected. Further, although drugs affect the coupling between neurons, only a few human studies have explicitly addressed how drugs modulate the functional connectome, i.e. the functional neural interactions within the brain. These studies have mainly focused on synchronization or correlation of brain activations. Recently, there are some drug studies using graph theory and other new mathematical approaches to model the brain as a complex network of interconnected processing nodes. Using such measures it is possible to detect not only focal, but also subtle, widely distributed drug effects on functional network topology. Most important, graph theoretical measures also quantify whether drug-induced changes in topology or network organization facilitate or hinder information processing. Several studies could show that functional brain integration is highly correlated with behavioral performance suggesting that cholinergic and noradrenergic drugs which improve measures of cognitive performance should increase functional network integration. The purpose of this paper is to show that graph theory provides a mathematical tool to develop theory-driven biomarkers of pro-cognitive drug effects, and also to discuss how these approaches can contribute to the understanding of the role of cholinergic and noradrenergic modulation in the human brain. Finally we discuss the ``global workspace'' theory as a theoretical framework of pro-cognitive drug effects and argue that pro-cognitive effects of cholinergic and noradrenergic drugs might be related to higher network integration.},

The classical engineering strategies of standardization, decoupling, and abstraction will have to be extended to take into account the inherent characteristics of biological devices and modules. To achieve predictability and reliability, strategies for engineering biology must include the notion of cellular context in the functional definition of devices and modules, use rational redesign and directed evolution for system optimization, and focus on accomplishing tasks using cell populations rather than individual cells. The discussion brings to light issues at the heart of designing complex living systems and provides a trajectory for future development.},

  abstract = {Charles Babbage began the quest to build an intelligent machine in the nineteenth century. Despite finishing neither the Difference nor the Analytical engine, he was aware that the use of mental language for describing the functioning of such machines was figurative. In order to reverse this cautious stance, Alan Turing postulated two decisive ideas that contributed to give birth to Artificial Intelligence: the Turing machine and the Turing test. Nevertheless, a philosophical problem arises from regarding intelligence simulation and make-believe as sufficient to establish that programmed computers are intelligent and have mental states, especially given the nature of mind and its characteristic first-person viewpoint. The origin of Artificial Intelligence is undoubtedly linked to the accounts that inspired John Searle to coin the term strong AI \rule{1em}{1pt}or the view that simply equates computers and minds. Especially emphasising the divergence between algorithmic processes and intentional mental states, the Chinese Room thought experiment shows that, since the mind is embodied and able to realise when linguistic understanding takes place, mental states require material implementation, a point that directly conflicts with the accounts that reduce the mind to the functioning of a programmed computer. The experience of linguistic understanding with its typical quale leads to other important philosophical issues. Searle's theory of intentionality holds that intentional mental states have conditions of satisfaction and appear in semantic networks; thus people know when they understand and what terms are about. In contrast, a number of philosophers maintain that consciousness is only an illusion and that it plays no substantial biological role. However, consciousness is a built-in feature of the system. Moreover, neurological evidence suggests that conscious mental states, qualia and},

Considering the apparent shortcomings of behaviorism, identity theory, function- alism and qualia eliminativism when explaining qualia, it is more likely than not that qualia are causally efficacious. This fact can have serious repercussions for research in Artificial Intelligence. I will present the Chinese Room argument, which showed why early optimism about AI was unfounded.

  abstract = {Mereology (from the Greek {$\mu\epsilon\rho{}o\varsigma$},`part') is the theory of parthood relations: of therelations of part to whole and the relations of part to part within a whole.[1] Its roots can be traced back to the early days of philosophy,beginning with the Presocratics and continuing throughout the writingsof Plato (especially the Parmenides and theTheaetetus), Aristotle (especially the Metaphysics,but also the Physics, the Topics, and Departibus animalium), and Boethius (especially DeDivisione and In Ciceronis Topica). Mereology occupies aprominent role also in the writings of medieval ontologists andscholastic philosophers such as Garland the Computist, Peter Abelard,Thomas Aquinas, Raymond Lull, John Duns Scotus, Walter Burley, Williamof Ockham, and Jean Buridan, as well as in Jungius's LogicaHamburgensis (1638), Leibniz's Dissertatio de artecombinatoria (1666) and Monadology (1714), and Kant'searly writings (the Gedanken of 1747 and the Monadologiaphysica of 1756). As a formal theory of parthood relations,however, mereology made its way into our times mainly through the workof Franz Brentano and of his pupils, especially Husserl's thirdLogical Investigation (1901). The latter may rightly beconsidered the first attempt at a thorough formulation of a theory,though in a format that makes it difficult to disentangle the analysisof mereological concepts from that of other ontologically relevantnotions (such as the relation of ontological dependence).[2] It is not until Le{\'s}niewski's Foundations of the GeneralTheory of Sets (1916) and his Foundations of Mathematics(1927\textendash{}1931) that a pure theory of part-relations was given anexact formulation.[3] And because Le{\'s}niewski's work was largely inaccessible tonon-speakers of Polish, it is only with the publication of Leonard andGoodman's The Calculus of Individuals (1940), partly underthe influence of Whitehead, that mereology has become a chapter ofcentral interest for modern ontologists and metaphysicians.[4], In the following we focus mostly on contemporary formulations ofmereology as they grew out of these recenttheories\textemdash{}Le{\'s}niewski's and Leonard and Goodman's. Indeed,although such theories come in different logical guises, they aresufficiently similar to be recognized as a common basis for mostsubsequent developments. To properly assess the relative strengths andweaknesses, however, it will be convenient to proceed in steps. Firstwe consider some core mereological notions and principles. Then weproceed to an examination of the stronger theories that can be erectedon that basis.},

  abstract = {This thesis aims to advance the study of cognitive science by examining the ``levels metaphor.'' The levels metaphor is defined as the application of levels talk to various aspects of scientific investigation. The thesis examines several applications of the levels metaphor within cognitive science and provides a conceptual framework for analyzing discussion. The thesis argues for a pluralistic approach to levels. The main claim is that different applications of the levels metaphor are justified insofar as attention is paid to how and why the metaphor is deployed. To show that my approach has practical applications, I discuss the role of levels within computational cognitive modeling.},
