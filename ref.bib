	abstract = {The European Social Survey ({ESS}) is an academically-driven multi-country survey, which has been administered in over 30 countries to date. Its three aims are, firstly â€“ to monitor and interpret changing public attitudes and values within Europe and to investigate how they interact with Europe's changing institutions, secondly - to advance and consolidate improved methods of cross-national survey measurement in Europe and beyond, and thirdly - to develop a series of European social indicators, including attitudinal indicators.

In the eighth round, the survey covers 23 countries and employs the most rigorous methodologies. From Round 7 it is funded by the Members, Observers and Guests of {ESS} European Research Infrastructure Consortium ({ESS} {ERIC}) who represent national governments. Participating countries directly fund the central coordination costs of the {ESS} {ERIC}, as well the costs of fieldwork and national coordination in their own country.

The survey involves strict random probability sampling, a minimum target response rate of 70\% and rigorous translation protocols. The hour-long face-to-face interview includes questions on a variety of core topics repeated from previous rounds of the survey and also two modules developed for Round 8 covering Public Attitudes to Climate Change, Energy Security, and Energy Preferences and Welfare Attitudes in a Changing Europe (the latter is a partial repeat of a module from Round 4).},
